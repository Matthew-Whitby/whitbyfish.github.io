Good evening

There has just been announced that the live performance at Shibuya Public Hall on the 28th
will be cancelled

A concert without an audience
We're going to be livestreaming it instead


First of all, I'd like to thank everyone who's been looking forward to it
since October when we announced it.
I feel really sorry for you

We all have our own lives to live
and you've been making time just to see us


But it's nobody's fault
To be honest, it's very frustrating and san


When discussing it with the staff
There was some talk about postponing it
But we're still doing it because it's been 5 years since we formed
I wanted to make sure that we delivered a meaningful concert
So I'm sad that I can't do the concert in front of you in person
But I'm still so happy to be able to do the 5th anniversary show on te 28th


It's about a week until the main event
From here on out, I'm going to change my feelings
I'm going to do my best to put on a good show

Honestly, it's easy to cancel a concert
but it's a show which needs to be done on the 28th
and everyone's worked so hard to make it happen
For the staff working on this live
I am so grateful


Carrying the thoughts of many people on our backs
We'll do our best in the concert!


Although it has become a livestream
I'm not going to change how I approach it whether it's at a concert or on a livestream

Now we want our performance to reach the Waship

Please look forward to it^ ^

It may not be this time, but one day I hope we will get to see a view of a full hall!
