How are you spending your days?

I hope everyone is staying at home as much as possible


I'm Mishina Ruka, someone who is good at staying indoors


I've never been the type to go out on trips/holidays
so this doesn't trouble me much
When it comes to my daily life, there's not much difference
Things are becoming quite uncertain though aren't they

I've been doing more that I usually would at home, and for me that's great

April fools day happened recently

Wasuta went with the concept of "Fly" this year!

The management were concerned with "that thing" for so long that in the corner of my mind, I thought they'd forgotten about it
I decided on the concept of "fly"

I'm a member of the Fly club
There are 2 members of the club with the other being the leader, Kodama

It's my third year so it's time for me to retire
Over the last 3 years we haven't gained a single member so the club hasn't grown. So we're on the verge of being disbanded.

We've devoted 3 years of our lives to flying, a place that's important to us, and we're hoping to get more members for the last fly.

That was our scenario

It was a wonderful mystery
We had a great time, let's go

This is the back story:
I was actually planning to go skydiving, but I gave up due to various reasons.
When I gave up, I decided to go bungee jumping. But, due to various reasons, I gave up on that too.

That's why I joined the fly club.

It's annoying
I really wanted to do it


I'll just have to fly in my own time


That's what April fools day was like
Thank you for your continued support this year ^_^

I've always wanted to do this, it was fun

See ya
