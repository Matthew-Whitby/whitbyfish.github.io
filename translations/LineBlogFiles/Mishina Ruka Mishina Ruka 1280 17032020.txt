Good evening

It's Mishina Ruka


I'm celebrating my birthday

Yaay

I'm 19

"Another year has passed"
is what I think every year

It feels like it's going by pretty fast
I'm having a good day

I forgot about all the goals I made a year ago
but throughout the year I've been finding more which is.. well... okay


I wonder what this year will be like〜 I wonder〜
But there are so many things I want to do


In the end, it's all about having fun

I'm committed to having fun in the moment
I'm having a lot of fun right now

It's not the same as a feeling of satisfaction, so it's not like that

Well, it's fun

!

I'm thinking of becoming more greedy too

I'm kind of scared of my teenage years coming to an end
This year, I'm going to be a little more enthusiastic!

Something like that!

I want everyone to have a good time too〜

It's been a really good year, thank you, with lots of love!
I'll be happy if you watch over me this year too

Thanks for reading〜＾＾
