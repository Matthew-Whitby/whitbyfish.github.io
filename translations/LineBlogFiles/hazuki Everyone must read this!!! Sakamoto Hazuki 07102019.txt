Have you seen the STUDIO LIVE's yet?🎸✨

With us on the stage on the 10/8
will be the NEKONOTE BAND who've been doing photo shoots and filming videos with us!!

The videos are quite impressive too✨！


I've been thinking about what I can do for the free live, because all the members are doing various things for it, but I can't think of anything to do, so I'm going to write a blog, which all the members are doing, too!

I want to convey that in my writing

Well, I'll summarize the uploaded videos here!

🌟The biggest paradox

{yt}https://www.youtube.com/embed/N6Sg-pDttAA?feature=oembed

It's really fun to do live!!!!!
The lyrics are lovely too, so be sure to check it out☺️

🌟New Nyaku Nyakunya Suizokukan2

{yt}https://www.youtube.com/embed/sJonSM4TbGg?feature=oembed

This is a very cute song, full of pitter-pattering sounds, with all kinds of fish appearing
🐟💓

🌟Ultra Miraclecle Final Ultimate Choco Beam

{yt}https://www.youtube.com/embed/JRPL9ZuKMZc?feature=oembed

This song is based on the theme of an RPG game
It's super exciting to perform live✨！！！

Actually, it's a love song😯、、

Triceratops -> person you love
Choco beam -> trying to appeal to them

I approach the person I like a lot and try to appeal to them, but it doesn't work!!!!!

Then, at the end...☺️💓

🌟Stand Alone Complex

{yt}https://www.youtube.com/embed/P4_Pr0zSLRQ?feature=oembed

One of Wasuta's twin vocal songs
three performers 💃form the basis of the song

The song is sung by the two vocal members
and the performance members don't have microphones
We're expressing the lyrics through dance!!!

It's a song about the feelings of the 5 Wasuta members✨
Who come from different parts of Japan

🌟PLATONIC GIRL

{yt}https://www.youtube.com/embed/TK-mu1WLSl0?feature=oembed

The band song!🎸✨

Of course it's one of the most exciting songs to perform live, but the band really completes it!!!!!!

It's not the same as Stand Alone Complex
Though there's also only 2 singers in this song✨！
It's our strongest song✨✨、、

The STUDIO LIVE's show a close up of the performances
These 5 songs will be performed at the free live on Oct. 8th
We will perform all sorts of songs with the band members

There are videos of each of the band playing the songs on their own channels if they have one
They're up now, so be sure to check them out✨

I don't know much about musical instruments, but I'm really excited.
I want to see it at least once.😯

And be sure to check out other videos too! Give them a watch☺️✨


Now, it's finally tomorrow.


It's a free show so we won't know how many people are going to turn up on the day


However, with the help of Wasuta's staff
and with the help of everyone in the Waship
I'm sure there will be a huge turnout


I don't want to go overboard、、

But if it's Wasuta we're talking about, it would naturally be about that many
Maybe even twice as much

I'd like to, let's say, collect people?

If we think about gathering them, they will gather


I want to have a performance that transcends the barriers of being an idol


It's like: "Just because you're an idol doesn't mean you can't do it?" (lol)
We will do it!!!!!!!!


It's a weekday and it starts at 6pm, however,
It's a free live, so it's free

Because I'm calling you, we'll take on the challenge of doing a serious set list

If you can't come because of your schedule or distance
I hope you'll come to the Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka and Fukushima tour

If you're thinking of going, then go.
In that case I definitely want you to come so you don't think "ahh, I wish I'd gone"


It's free
But the quality of the performance will be as good as ever

We won't cut any corners. Really.

You don't have to be on time for the event, do your best, still come even if you are going to be late!!!

To all the staff who prepared this stage and gave us a chance.
Thank you so much.

You have worked so hard for us
All the staff
The Waship have also always been so supportive of me
To everyone coming to see us for the first time
We'll give you the best show to return the favor


Because the members of the NEKONOTE BAND are here
There's nothing to be afraid of when it comes to the sound!!!! They're the strongest??


Tomorrow! Enjoy! It's going to be the best day ever!
This will be a legendary day in the history of Wasuta!!!🔥
