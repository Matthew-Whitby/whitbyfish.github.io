Have you seen the STUDIO LIVE's yet?🎸✨

With us on the stage on the 10/8
will be the NEKONOTE BAND who've been doing photo shoots and filming videos with us!!

The video is quite impressive too✨！


I've been thinking about what I can do for the free live, because all the members are doing various things for it, but I can't think of anything to do, so I'm going to write a blog, which all the members are doing, too!

I want to convey that in my writing

Well, I'll summarize the uploaded videos here!

🌟The biggest paradox

{yt}https://www.youtube.com/embed/N6Sg-pDttAA?feature=oembed

It's really fun to do live!!!!!
The lyrics are lovely too, so be sure to check it out☺️

🌟New Nyaku Nyakunya Suizokukan2
This is a very cute song, full of pitter-pattering sounds, with all kinds of fish appearing
🐟💓

🌟Ultra Miraclecle Final Ultimate Choco Beam
This song is based on the theme of an RPG game
It's super exciting to perform live✨！！！

Actually, it's a love song😯、、

Triceratops -> person you love
Choco beam -> trying to appeal to them

I approach the person I like a lot and try to appeal to them, but it doesn't work!!!!!

Then, at the end...☺️💓

🌟Stand Alone Complex
One of Wasuta's twin vocal songs
three performers 💃form the basis of the song

The song is sung by the two vocal members
and the performance members don't have microphones
We're expressing the lyrics through dance!!!

It's a song about the feelings of the 5 Wasuta members✨
Who come from different parts of Japan

🌟PLATONIC GIRL
The band song!🎸✨

Of course it's one of the most exciting songs to perform live, but the band really completes it!!!!!!

It's not the same as Stand Alone Complex
Though there's also only 2 singers in this song✨！
It's our strongest song✨✨、、

The STUDIO LIVE's show a close up of the performances
These 5 songs will be performed at the free live on Oct. 8th
We will perform all sorts of songs with the band members
