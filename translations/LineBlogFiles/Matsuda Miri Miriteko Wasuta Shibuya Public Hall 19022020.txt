Good morning

I've been alone, crying with joy since noon
I'm 20 years old (Ôø£‚ñΩÔø£) (lol)

To date, Wasuta has played so many big shows
I've lost count

From the beginning I never would have thought we'd have got so many challenges

This isn't just a matter of our courage or anything like that
FINISH SECTION

It's something to poke at
I'm so frustrated and sad
I feel like there was a time when all I could do was cry

It's only now that I can say thatüê∂hahaha


But even in the midst of it all, they let me do new things
Thanks to the passionate staff

I've got a friend who's been watching over me and cheering me on
Thanks for being there

I think I've done a lot of things
I've learned a lot from them and have been able to bounce back


That's what I've learned

I'm going to use it to my advantage and go to bigger places
To everyone who's been involved

I wanted to return the favour
I've imagined all kinds of scenery„Éº„Éº„Éº„Éº


Goals are something you work hard to achieve

Thank you for making me do my best


And with that
#„Çè„Éº„Åô„ÅüÊ∏ãË∞∑ÂÖ¨‰ºöÂ†Ç (Wasuta Shibuya Public Hall)
5th anniversary live

It's sold out, thank you!


When we achieved our goal in the free live and decided to hold it
My feelings about the concert from the beginning are growing more and more

Rehearsals have already started
I'm having so much fun, and I'm having so many dreams
