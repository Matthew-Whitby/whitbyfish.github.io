I've been alone, crying with joy since noon
I'm 20 years old (Ôø£‚ñΩÔø£) (lol)

To date, Wasuta has played so many big shows
I've lost count

First of all I couldn't get past the challenges

This isn't just a matter of our courage or anything like that
FINISH SECTION

It's just something to poke at
I'm so frustrated and sad
I feel like there was a time when all I could do was cry

It's only now that I can say thatüê∂hahaha


But even in the midst of it all, they let me do new things
Thanks to the passionate staff

I've got a friend who's been watching over me and cheering me on
Thanks for being there

I think I've done a lot of things
I've learned a lot from them and have been able to bounce back


That's what I've learned

I'm going to use it to my advantage and go to bigger places
To everyone who's been involved

I wanted to return the favour
I've imagined all kinds of scenery„Éº„Éº„Éº„Éº


Goals are something you work hard to achieve

Thank you for making me do my best


And with that
#„Çè„Éº„Åô„ÅüÊ∏ãË∞∑ÂÖ¨‰ºöÂ†Ç (Wasuta Shibuya Public Hall)
5th anniversary live

It's sold out, thank you!


When we achieved our goal in the free live and decided to hold it
My feelings about the concert from the beginning are growing more and more

Rehearsals have already started
I'm having so much fun, and I'm having so many dreams

I'm just trying my bestüåº
Wasuta is very much alive right now
I'm so happy to see that!

I'm glad


Wasuta will put all our love into the music and deliver it to everyone

Every song I've ever sung, every dance I've ever danced to
I'll continue to take pride in the scenery I've seen
I'm going to stand on the stage


I look forward to working with you


Oh, On the day there will be a lot of loud voices
and lots of purple glowsticks
I look forward to it (lol)

I want to be able to see where all of my fans are


(Ôø£‚ñΩÔø£)

There's also a live band
We'll display all sorts of wonderful things

I'm looking forward to it


Thanks for reading
