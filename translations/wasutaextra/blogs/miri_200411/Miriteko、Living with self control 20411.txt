Good day


Will corona come here too?
the feeling of uneasiness at home
Even I'm starting to feel it

Oh yeah, I went to take out the trash yesterday
So I went outside (lol)

It's been a while since I walked even a few meters outside
There were tulips in the flowerbed outside the house
That was enough to get me excited
though I felt like crying at the same time


I can't help but feel how wonderful and charming they are everydayüå∑


Since our one man show
I've put up the flowers I got as a present in my room

I've been watering them a lot
I'm glad they're still blooming beautifully


But today, I found a wrinkled area around the edge of one of the flowers

Thank you for blooming so beautifullyÔΩû

It's ephemeralüòûüòûüòû‚ùÅ‚Éò*.Ôæü


Recently, my days and nights sometimes reverse
then they temporarily fix
but then reverse again

If I live my life with the intention of finding a little happiness
even if it's just once a day
I feel like I can make itÔºÅÔºÅ

I was under the illusion that if you stayed at home all the time
You'd start to get quite bored

It's like doing chores you don't like
but then you start to enjoy them

I don't wear any makeup or style my hair nicely or anything like that
But I do take care of my skin to keep my femininity up

I take more care of my hair after the bath, I change my nails, I wear cute pajamas and put on perfume

For some reason, I was told not to play games too much outside of livestreaming (maybe I overdid it)
and I got depressed and cried, or forced my way through a game

I'm used to recharging my batteries by meeting and talking to people
so I'm grateful to my friends who make time for me on the phone


I might be a little too busy


All this time I've been working
I've been so tired that I've slept and slept and slept and woke up wanting nothing more than to work and play games

I'm at a level where my brain is nothing but work and games
That's all I was really into

It's been a long time since I've just been a human being
and it's a strange feeling

Even if I'm waking up at crazy times, I've never immediately washed up or done the laundry up till now


I just want to be an idol after all
I'm going to miss it for now

That's why I'm trying to stay healthy
I'm going to stick it out now‚ö°Ô∏è



Yesterday, I made Hayashi riceÔΩû
It was delicious with milk and sauceüòé

Cutting the carrots and onions and other ingredients
into small parts to make it almost soup like
It was deliciousÔΩû

I made it out of stuff I had at home
Next time I want to buy mushrooms and put them in„ÉºÔºÅ

That was Matsuda Miri

A status report blog? I think so


Oh and I'm watching Carp2020 too
Looking at Matsuda move around
Don't forget about Matsuda-chan! (lol)

At about 1:50 in
Matsuda-chan rains in from above‚öæÔ∏è.


Thanks for reading to the end

and even if we can't meet
Thank you for sending us your love on social media

Thanks to that I'm not worried
That's what I'm thinking now„ÄÇI think at least„ÄÇ
Good luck, I hope we can meet again soon


Matsuda Miri
