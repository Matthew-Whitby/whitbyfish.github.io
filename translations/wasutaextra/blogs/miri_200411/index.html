<h1>Miriteko、Living with self control</h1>
<h3>2020/4/11 21:24</h3>
<p>Good day
</p>
<br><p>Will corona come here too?
<br>the feeling of uneasiness at home
<br>Even I'm starting to feel it
</p>
<img class="lazyload" data-src="https://obs.line-scdn.net/0h8C9V45RRZ2wEL0-avH8YO3JyYQN9TH1kbldwVnF5bUJxQ3BsbFVtU3VpZx90SmJ_aBZ9WmJ6JS5sQlNGaBJDfkh0Ox1Vb0t_cyteU2lxPRdrR0JCWwFTFiErMFsuHiY4P08oAnQsMF8rG2U7axt9X3J4Pw/small

<p>Oh yeah, I went to take out the trash yesterday
<br>So I went outside (lol)
</p>
<p>It's been a while since I walked even a few meters outside
<br>There were tulips in the flowerbed outside the house
<br>That was enough to get me excited
<br>though I felt like crying at the same time
</p>
<br><p>I can't help but feel how wonderful and charming they are everyday🌷
</p>
<br><p>Since our one man show
<br>I've put up the flowers I got as a present in my room
</p>
<p>I've been watering them a lot
<br>I'm glad they're still blooming beautifully
</p>
<br><p>But today, I found a wrinkled area around the edge of one of the flowers
</p>
<p>Thank you for blooming so beautifully～
</p>
<p>It's ephemeral😞😞😞❁⃘*.ﾟ
</p>
<br><p>Recently, my days and nights sometimes reverse
<br>then they temporarily fix
<br>but then reverse again
</p>
<p>If I live my life with the intention of finding a little happiness
<br>even if it's just once a day
<br>I feel like I can make it！！
</p>
<p>I was under the illusion that if you stayed at home all the time
<br>You'd start to get quite bored
</p>
<p>It's like doing chores you don't like
<br>but then you start to enjoy them
</p>
<p>I don't wear any makeup or style my hair nicely or anything like that
<br>But I do take care of my skin to keep my femininity up
</p>
<p>I take more care of my hair after the bath, I change my nails, I wear cute pajamas and put on perfume
</p>
<p>For some reason, I was told not to play games too much outside of livestreaming (maybe I overdid it)
<br>and I got depressed and cried, or forced my way through a game
</p>
<p>I'm used to recharging my batteries by meeting and talking to people
<br>so I'm grateful to my friends who make time for me on the phone
</p>
<br><p>I might be a little too busy
</p>
<br><p>All this time I've been working
<br>I've been so tired that I've slept and slept and slept and woke up wanting nothing more than to work and play games
</p>
<p>I'm at a level where my brain is nothing but work and games
<br>That's all I was really into
</p>
<p>It's been a long time since I've just been a human being
<br>and it's a strange feeling
</p>
<p>Even if I'm waking up at crazy times, I've never immediately washed up or done the laundry up till now
</p>
<br><p>I just want to be an idol after all
<br>I'm going to miss it for now
</p>
<p>That's why I'm trying to stay healthy
<br>I'm going to stick it out now⚡️
</p>
<br><br><p>Yesterday, I made Hayashi rice～
<br>It was delicious with milk and sauce😎

<p>Cutting the carrots and onions and other ingredients
<br>into small parts to make it almost soup like
<br>It was delicious～
</p>
<p>I made it out of stuff I had at home
<br>Next time I want to buy mushrooms and put them inー！
</p>
<br><p>🍄
</p>
<br><p>That was Matsuda Miri
</p>
<p>A status report blog? I think so
</p>
<br><p>Oh and I'm watching Carp2020 too
<br>Looking at Matsuda move around
<br>Don't forget about Matsuda-chan! (lol)
</p>
<p>At about 1:50 in
<br>Matsuda-chan rains in from above⚾️.
</p>
<br><p>Thanks for reading to the end
</p>
<p>and even if we can't meet
<br>Thank you for sending us your love on social media
</p>
<p>Thanks to that I'm not worried
<br>That's what I'm thinking now。I think at least。
<br>Good luck, I hope we can meet again soon
</p>
<br><p>Matsuda Miri
