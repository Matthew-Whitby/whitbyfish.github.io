The year is already over„Äú„ÄúÔºÅ

It feels too early for it to be over„ÄÅ„ÄÅ„ÄÅ


Looking back on the year

Until March
For Wasuta's ÔΩ¢Wonderful YEARÔΩ£
We released a new song every month

At the end of March, the one man live 4th anniversary show was an important event

That period was so busy


There were lots of moments where anxiety piled up


But I can confidently say that the show was a great time!
It was a live performance that I can say I was glad I did


It's important to meet everyone

and the love that people have for each other is so great
It's so warm
It made me realise how much I can move people's hearts


It was the first time I'd felt that in my life



I'm not sure if I even realised at the time,
but even remembering it now brings tears to my eyes!


We performed the song "Igurenai Heart" for the first time on this day
It was one of the best I've ever seen‚ò∫Ô∏é„ÄÇ


Also
In May, I turned 20

by the way

It's a very important point in my life, but
In the past I would never have thought it
but it wasn't that much of a change for me
I still don't feel like it's that big of an eventÔºÅ·ôèÃ§Ã´ÔºàlolÔºâüíß


But as an idol
This feeling of youth
maybe it's a good thing‚ò∫Ô∏é‚ô™lol


I also remember my birthday event vividly


Then in June

Wasuta Kawaii Quest

The first ever live game
I was happy to see everyone's reactions„Äú‚ú®


I've been able to play a lot of festivals and events in the summer

While at times it was frustrating
I feel like I'm stringer


That day was the most difficult day in the history of KIRA KIRA Holograms
where I pushed my feelings to the limit and gave them my all.

It's a feeling I'll never forget



And on October the 8th
The number one event this year for me

The free live at Yoyogi Park!


There were moments when my pride got the better of me during the time I've been active as a Wasuta.
