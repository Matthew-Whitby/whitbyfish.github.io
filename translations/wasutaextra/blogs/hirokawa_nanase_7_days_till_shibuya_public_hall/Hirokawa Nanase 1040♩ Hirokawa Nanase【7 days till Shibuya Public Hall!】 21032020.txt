Hello!

It's Nanase

It's been a long time since I last wrote a blog〜〜⸌⍤⃝⸍


Today is about the 3/28
I'm going to write about the Shibuya Public Hall

First, let's start at the beginning
It's scheduled to happen on 3/28
However the 5th anniversary one-man live at the Shibuya Public Hall
was cancelled due to the new coronavirus

It will instead be delivered as a livestream with no audience at the venue

You've kept your schedule open for me
The cost of the plane ticket/transport to get here
Hotel charges
Other things we can't see
I'm sorry I've put you all through so much><


There was a free live at Yoyogi park on October the 8th
and from there the Shibuya Public Hall show was scheduled

It's my first time performing in a hall and a one-man show too
I was really looking forward to it
We were all together again, and we had already achieved our goal of a sell out earlier than expected

People may say that it's because of our hard work, but to me, it's unmistakably thanks to everyone. Thanks☺︎


This scene at the Shibuya Public Hall
I've seen it in my dreams over and over again, even today

Each time, I looked forward to the view from the stage

Of course, over all these months
I didn't think for a second that it would be cancelled

"I'll make the Shibuya Public Hall concert a success no matter what!"
That was all I could think about

I can't believe we're in such a situation right now, and all I can think about is why it had to happen at such an important time


But even in rehearsals
Actually, I'm having a change of heart

because...

"I don't know what will happen to the live show on 3/28 because of the situation"
that kind of thing was said a lot of course


Honestly, I was saying these kinds of things
and thinking "no... but...."
Because I couldn't accept it. in my head there was no way we couldn't do it

But

"Even if it becomes impossible to hold the event
What we deliver to the fans remains the same"

There were moments when I felt so strongly about that

I think it's all thanks to the staff who I work with, the band members, and the members of Wasuta that I came to that conclusion

Deciding whether we do it or not, of course, is important
but what's more important is
"delivering a good performance"

I realised that this feeling had become very important to me when we were rehearsing


But that doesn't mean I immediately accepted it when I heard about the cancellation, and it's still frustrating to this day

But whatever form it takes
What we want to deliver remains the same


I'm really grateful that such an environment was able to be created for me in such a short period of time
I'm sure the best way to do it is with a live concert, but even so, this is the only time we can celebrate the 5th anniversary of Wasuta
I'm thinking how grateful I am to be able to deliver it now


To Waship all over Japan, to Waship all over the world
and to everyone who has yet to become a fan
Anyway, I hope you enjoy this 5th anniversary show!


And now we have an environment where we can see more people than the capacity of the sold-out Shibuya Public Hall

It's way beyond that capacity
I hope a lot of people see it!


3/28 17:00〜start time

It'll be great fun
I promise to deliver a live which will draw you in

Our positive decisions
Please give us a slap on the back


Thanks for reading to the end!


There are only 7 days until the Wasuta Shibuya Public Hall performance

I'm looking forward to it now ☺︎

From here
Is for those who want to read it! (lol)

In "Grapefruit moon"

"Always, always wishing, but I still can't reach it
The closer I get, the further away I am"

This song was originally written with us in mind but
I think these lyrics are especially suitable for us now……⠉̫⃝⠉̮⃝⠉̭⃞

The closer you get, the further away you get

I'm probably not even close to the future I'm envisioning yet
That's why I think I can still work hard


I'm sure you all know that
we don't have time to stand around like this!


After the Shibuya Public Hall

We'll turn adversity into an ally
I hope the 5 of us can become stronger after this
