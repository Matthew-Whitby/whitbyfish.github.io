However, I haven't been able to eat any local dishes from Osaka
It's a little sad

It's pretty sad

well, can't help it

no, but I wanted to eat some delicious food
We had yakiniku last night, so it's okay
It's all good


Just some normal Takoyaki
I'm in the mood for it

wa-----

I'll be back


There are so many places I'd like to go to, so please wait for me, alright?

Actually, I was back at my parents' house not long ago
So I've been re-energised


Pokota wouldn't get along though
After returning to Tokyo, dad told me that Poko-chan is sleeping quietly and calmly
like he's feeling really sorry
hahahaha〜so sad〜

It was fun〜being home
We talked about coming of age and stuff
It's not too far away
I feel uneasy


But nothing'll change and it'll be fun
I can do it

These days, I'm like
How are you doing? every day

I gotta wake up early tomorrow
So I'm gonna get some sleep today
