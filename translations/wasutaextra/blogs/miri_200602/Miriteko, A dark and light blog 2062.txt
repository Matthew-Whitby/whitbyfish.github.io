I've got my forehead on display today

There's a mess of newly growing hair on my forehead (lol)


I had a good day because I had delicious dumplings with my mom

We had a good day just walking around!


I had a bad dream this morning
Because of it, I've realized that even mundane times are happy times

I wrote about it a bit on twitter
I haven't had such dreams since I was a kid
I'm going *FINISH*


For the first time I had a dream about my life ending ü•ö

My family and I were all at home, and we were spending time together

For some reason, my mom went to the hospital to ask about the fact that Miri's body couldn't be saved (for real)

Rather than being afraid or in pain or wanting to do something while I'm still alive, what I thought when I dreamed about it was

I felt like I needed to value this space with my nondescript family and my words to others more

I'm so happy where I am now that I don't want to let go and yet I'm filled with sadness that I'm going to be gone 

I was desperately trying to tell my family that I loved them so, so much

I still get tears in my eyes when I think about it, because it's so hard to think about it, my hands almost shake a little bit.

I cried even more, thanks to my mom hugging me whilst I was already crying (lol)

I woke up and we had a long talk, but even then, I cried

Maybe I've been lacking in compassion for my family lately
and have been objectifying myself‚òÅÔ∏è

I think it was a dream that helped me realize some good things!!

Thank you for being there for me
all of you!

and thank you for the dream~

No, but
I'm turning 21 in just two months
I don't want to get old

I'm in trouble

(lol)

I want to see more people and meet them soon

My body is a little sore from muscle training yesterday
That's me~

When you think "This is what makes me happy right now" you smile, so try it!

Thanks for reading!

Good night

Matsuda MiriÔºè
