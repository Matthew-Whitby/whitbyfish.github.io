<h3>2020/3/20 19:15</h3>
<p>Good evening
</p>
<p>It has just been announced that the live performance at Shibuya Public Hall on the 28th
<br>will be cancelled
</p>
<p>A concert without an audience
<br>We're going to be livestreaming it instead
</p>
<br><p>First of all, I'd like to thank everyone who's been looking forward to it
<br>since October when we announced it.
<br>I feel really sorry for you
</p>
<p>We all have our own lives to live
<br>and you've been making time just to see us
</p>
<br><p>But it's nobody's fault
<br>To be honest, it's very frustrating and sad
</p>
<br><p>When discussing it with the staff
<br>There was some talk about postponing it
<br>But it's been 5 years since we formed so we're still doing it
<br>I wanted to make sure that we delivered a meaningful concert
<br>So I'm sad that I can't do the concert in front of you in person
<br>But I'm still so happy to be able to do the 5th anniversary show on the 28th
</p>
<br><p>It's about a week until the main event
<br>From here on out, I'm going to change my feelings
<br>I'm going to do my best to put on a good show
</p>
<p>Honestly, it's easy to cancel a concert
<br>but it's a show which needs to be done on the 28th
<br>and everyone's worked so hard to make it happen
<br>For the staff working on this live
<br>I am so grateful
</p>
<br><p>Carrying the thoughts of many people on our backs
<br>We'll do our best in the concert!
</p>
<br><p>Although it has become a livestream
<br>I'm not going to change how I approach it whether it's at a concert or on a livestream
</p>
<p>Now we want our performance to reach the Waship
</p>
<p>Please look forward to it^ ^
</p>

<p>It may not be this time, but one day I hope we will get to see a view of a full hall!
