<p>Oct 8, 2019<br>Thank you so much for the free live</p>
<br><p>It was like a dreamy time</p>
<br><p>It was fun to see how our voices and songs conveyed<br>what we wanted to convey through our live sound</p>
<br><p>Just standing on stage<br>I got so excited<br>I was moved by the view from the stage<br>The feeling of everyone's warmth<br>I can still remember it very vividly after a day</p>
<br><p>It was so much fun</p>
<br><p>But all this fun and happiness<br>Because I worked so hard on so many things<br>I wonder if that made it even more fun and happy</p>
<br><br><p>We thought about how we could get more people to come see the show<br>We put out announcements on social media every day<br>We handed out flyers which we'd never done before</p>
<br><p>I think I am able to say it myself<br>I worked really hard</p>
<br><p>I'm sure everyone is wondering<br>why I was working so hard</p>
<br><p>I wanted to do a successful free live<br>A chance to grow as a group<br>Of course, I had those feelings<br>But there was actually another reason</p>
<br><p>I never thought I'd be able to tell you this<br>I wasn't expecting it but the staff<br>released a video featuring it, so I'll say it here tooo</p>
<br><br><p>"If 1,500 people show up,<br>we'll do a show at the Shibuya Public Hall on March the 28th"<br>I was told that</p>
<br><p>If a group can't bring in 1,500 people to a free show<br>Then challenging a 2,000 capacity hall<br>There's no way we'd fill it</p>
<br><br><p>Honestly, it was pretty scary</p>
<br><p>Only on the day of the event<br>did I have the confidence to say<br>that we'd be able to get 1,500 people</p>
<br><br><p>Before I'd always been anxious, scared and crying about it</p>
<br><br><p>We're going to play a concert in a hall<br>It's exciting to just imagine it<br>I've always wanted to do this, but<br>I just didn't have the confidence we could</p>
<br><p>But I knew that if I felt this way<br>Nothing would change<br>So I tried to do everything I could until the day of the event<br>and I did my best</p>
<br><p>When I thought about the hall<br>that was waiting for me if the free live succeeded<br>I worked really hard</p>

<p>I never would have imagined it<br>We got 3,000 people in attendance</p>
<img class="lazyload" data-src="https://obs.line-scdn.net/0hbDRteKRZPWtvDRaRmShCPBlQOwQWbidjBXUqURpbN0UaYSprB3c3VB5LPRgfaDh4AzQnXQlYf1wnay5FOilzaS9LATtARhtbMSkUcRZlYDJLfx1iIGNxEUoJZVpFP386U2pyBRhea1NLOz88Az4iDkkKYA/small">
<p>When we heard about those numbers</p>
<p>Of course we'd cryー。</p>
<br><p>It's all thanks to you guys</p>
<p>Thank you so much</p>
<br><p>The show was so much fun<br>It really flew by!</p>
<br><p>I'm sorry that everyone couldn't see us clearly</p>
<br><p>At the Shibuya Public Hall on the 28th of March<br>Everyone will have a good view of the stage<br>I hope you'll come and see me again</p>
<br><p>That's not all<br>At the Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka, Fukuoka tour and end of year thanksgiving show<br>So please look forward to all of those</p>
<br><br><p>I wrote this out of sheer momentum and emotion<br>I'm sorry if it's hard to read because of my messy writing</p>
<br><p>Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you<br>It was a blog I wanted to share with you</p>
<br><p>Wasuta<br>We're still going to do our best</p>
