Thank you so much for the free live


It was like a dreamy time


It was fun to see how our voices and songs conveyed
what we wanted to convey through our live sound


Just standing on stage
I got so excited
I was moved by the view from the stage
The feeling of everyone's warmth
I can still remember it very vividly after a day


It was so much fun


But all this fun and happiness
Because I worked so hard on so many things
I wonder if that made it even more fun and happy



We thought about how we could get more people to come see the show
We put out announcements on social media every day
We handed out flyers which we'd never done before


I think I am able to say it myself
I worked really hard


I'm sure everyone is wondering
why I was working so hard


I wanted to do a successful free live
A chance to grow as a group
Of course, I had those feelings
But there was actually another reason


I never thought I'd be able to tell you this
I wasn't expecting it but the staff
released a video featuring it, so I'll say it here too



"If 1,500 people show up,
we'll do a show at the Shibuya Public Hall on March the 28th"
I was told that


If a group can't bring in 1,500 people to a free show
Then challenging a 2,000 capacity hall
There's no way we'd fill it



Honestly, it was pretty scary


Only on the day of the event
did I have the confidence to say
that we'd be able to get 1,500 people



Before I'd always been anxious, scared and crying about it



We're going to play a concert in a hall
It's exciting to just imagine it
I've always wanted to do this, but
I just didn't have the confidence we could


But I knew that if I felt this way
Nothing would change
So I tried to do everything I could until the day of the event
and I did my best


When I thought about the hall
that was waiting for me if the free live succeeded
I worked really hard

I never would have imagined it
We got 3,000 people in attendance

When we heard about those numbers

Of course we'd cryー。


It's all thanks to you guys

Thank you so much


The show was so much fun
It really flew by!


I'm sorry that everyone couldn't see us clearly


At the Shibuya Public Hall on the 28th of March
Everyone will have a good view of the stage
I hope you'll come and see me again


That's not all
There's the Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka, Fukuoka tour and end of year thanksgiving show
So please look forward to all of those



I wrote this out of sheer momentum and emotion
I'm sorry if it's hard to read because of my messy writing


Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you
It was a blog I wanted to share with you


Wasuta
We're still going to do our best
