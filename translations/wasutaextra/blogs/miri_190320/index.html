<p>I think I quite like the shape of the right hand
<br>(the one wearing the ring)
</p>
<p>No, more than that
<br>I want you to look at the message on the hoodie
</p>
<br><p>Yes, today, the 19th of March
<br>It was Mishina Ruka's Birthday celebration!
</p>
<p>The hoodie is black
<br>and has pink text on the hood, easy for both men and women to wear
<br>It's so cute! Isn't it( ‚óú ‡øÄ ‚óù )
</p>
<br><p>Thanks for coming everyone
</p>
<p>The birthday committee (That's what it's called (after all this time))
<br>Thank you for your hard work
</p>
<br><p>I love everyone so much because we're able to celebrate birthdays like this
</p>
<p>The fact that you are making the members' faces happy like this
<br>I can really feel the love!
</p>
<br><p>Miri's really happy for youÔΩû
</p>
<br><p>Thanks for a great day!
</p>
<br><br><p>Last year, 17 year old Ruka showed off the guitar for the first time at her birthday celebration
<br>after only practicing it for a short time
</p>
<p>When I saw her performing with it again
<br>at her 18th birthday celebration
<br>I thought she was so cool
<br>I wanted to praise her myself
</p>
<br><p>Ruka, who can do everything so skilfully
<br>still puts loads of effort into it
</p>
<p>And what's more, I'm so jealous of how cute she is
<br>Miri loves this girl
</p>
<br><p>No matter how many years go by
<br>I'm sure I'll never forget it in my heart
<br>no matter what
</p>
<p>Not just to Ruka, but to the other members too
<br>I can say that kind of thing to all the people around me( ‚óú ‡øÄ ‚óù )
</p>
<br><br><p>It's something that I say every time a birthday comes around
<br>But it's also something that I think about everyday
</p>
<p>Hmmmm, I'm embarrassed (lol)
</p>
<br><p>It was such a warm and gentle atmosphere
<br>It was fun( ‚∏ù‚∏ù‚∏ù‚Ä¢ Ã´ ‚Ä¢ ‚∏ù‚∏ù‚∏ù )

<p>Thanks for the hard worküíÆ
</p>
<br><p>The two of them were in high school
<br>Ruka and Ririka have now graduated from high school and...
</p>
<p>We're all members of society now
<br>and I hope more of us can stand up for ourselves from now on‚òïÔ∏è
</p>
<br><p>Don't get carried away
<br>I'm going to do my best( ‚óú ‡øÄ ‚óù )‚ú®
</p>
<br><p>Good luck tomorrow everyone
</p>
<br><p>I'm glad you read to the end
<br>Thank you( ‚óú ‡øÄ ‚óù )
</p>
<p>Good night„Éº
