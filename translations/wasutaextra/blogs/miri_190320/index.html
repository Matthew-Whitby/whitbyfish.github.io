I think I quite like the shape of the right hand
(the one wearing the ring)

No, more than that
I want you to look at the message on the hoodie


Yes, today, the 19th of March
It was Mishina Ruka's Birthday celebration!

The hoodie is black
and has pink text on the hood, easy for both men and women to wear
It's so cute! Isn't it( ‚óú ‡øÄ ‚óù )


Thanks for coming everyone

The birthday committee (That's what it's called (after all this time))
Thank you for your hard work


I love everyone so much because we're able to celebrate birthdays like this

The fact that you are making the members' faces happy like this
I can really feel the love!


Miri's really happy for youÔΩû


Thanks for a great day!



Last year, 17 year old Ruka showed off the guitar for the first time at her birthday celebration
after only practicing it for a short time

When I saw her performing with it again
at her 18th birthday celebration
I thought she was so cool
I wanted to praise her myself


Ruka, who can do everything so skilfully
still puts loads of effort into it

And what's more, I'm so jealous of how cute she is
Miri loves this girl


No matter how many years go by
I'm sure I'll never forget it in my heart
no matter what

Not just to Ruka, but to the other members too
I can say that kind of thing to all the people around me( ‚óú ‡øÄ ‚óù )



It's something that I say every time a birthday comes around
But it's also something that I think about everyday

Hmmmm, I'm embarrassed (lol)


It was such a warm and gentle atmosphere
It was fun( ‚∏ù‚∏ù‚∏ù‚Ä¢ Ã´ ‚Ä¢ ‚∏ù‚∏ù‚∏ù )

Thanks for the hard worküíÆ


The two of them were in high school
Ruka and Ririka have now graduated from high school and...

We're all members of society now
and I hope more of us can stand up for ourselves from now on‚òïÔ∏è


Don't get carried away
I'm going to do my best( ‚óú ‡øÄ ‚óù )‚ú®


Good luck tomorrow everyone


I'm glad you read to the end
Thank you( ‚óú ‡øÄ ‚óù )

Good night„Éº

Matsuda MiriÔºè
