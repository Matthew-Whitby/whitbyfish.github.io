<h1>Mishina Ruka: 1281</h1>

<p>Good evening</p>
<p>It's Mishina Ruka</p>

<p>I'm writing this because I can't sleep because of the concert today (even though I'm sure the real reason is because I just can't sleep in general)</p>
<p>The 5th anniversary concert, the concert without an audience, is over!</p>
<p>It's really hard to put into words, but</p>
<p>It was fun</p>
<p>First of all, I'm really happy we got to perform at the Shibuya Public Hall, and I'm grateful that everyone was able to prepare the environment for me in such a short period of time</p>
<p>But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't help but feel frustrated</p>
<p>The lack of people makes me wonder whether if it was really a concert</p>
<p>Of course, there are times when I've sung in a similar setting in other livestreams, but it was originally meant to be a concert in front of a full audience, so it ended up feeling a bit lonely.I'd been looking forward to it ever since the Free Live at Yoyogi park</p>
<p>I was more frustrated than I thought I would be</p>
<p>And here I am again, so frustrated with myself for saying it</p>
<p>However it's not fun to just say this</p>
<p>I'm so glad that I was able to deliver the live performance even in such an inconvenient situation.</p>
<p>I'm sure there are a lot of people out there who aren't doing what they want to do, who are depressed, who are stressed out.And in the midst of all this, I just want to blow it all up and forget about it.I just want to make you feel like you're having fun and spend time with you.That was my first thought</p>
<p>I'll be happy if you had fun</p>
<p>I've done all I could do, but it wasn't enough, and I can't wait to perform with everyone again!</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>I feel like I've really spent a lot of time with everyone over the last 5 years.I felt it in my heart.Thank you so much for getting us this far.</p>
<p>We will continue to deliver many good things to you.We're going to have a lot of fun in the 6th year.It would be great if you could watch it!I'm still dancing and singing!</p>
<p>Again, it was a really good day.I think going on, we will look back on it being a good day</p>

<p>There's more to come</p>
