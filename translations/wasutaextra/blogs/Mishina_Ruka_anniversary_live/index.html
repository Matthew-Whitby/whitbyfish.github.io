<p>Good evening</p><p></p><p>It's Mishina Ruka</p><p></p><p><img src="https://obs.line-scdn.net/0hFF30OxShGWkOSTGOFZhmPngUHwZ3KgNhZDEOU3sfE0d7JQ5pZjMTVn8PGRp-LBx6YnADX2gcWzplMQ1Ncl0hdkIXOllbPFk3ZngvTXktIi1wHS4_aFMEEytNTl0mfV04NCZWB35KT1gjfBs-YXwEDX5PQA/small">
</p><p></p><p>I'm writing this because I can't sleep because of the concert today (even though I'm sure the real reason is because I just can't sleep in general)</p><p></p><p>The 5th anniversary concert, the concert without an audience, is over!</p><p></p><p>It's really hard to put into words, but</p><p></p><p>It was fun</p><p></p><p>First of all, I'm really happy we got to perform at the Shibuya Public Hall, and I'm grateful that everyone was able to prepare the environment for me in such a short period of time</p><p></p><p>But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't help but feel frustrated</p><p></p><p>The lack of people makes me wonder whether if it was really a concert</p><p></p><p>Of course, there are times when I've sung in a similar setting in other livestreams, but it was originally meant to be a concert in front of a full audience, so it ended up feeling a bit lonely.</p><p>I'd been looking forward to it ever since the Free Live at Yoyogi park</p><p></p><p>I was more frustrated than I thought I would be</p><p></p><p>And here I am again, so frustrated with myself for saying it</p><p></p><p>However it's not fun to just say this</p><p></p><p>I'm so glad that I was able to deliver the live performance even in such an inconvenient situation.</p><p></p><p>I'm sure there are a lot of people out there who aren't doing what they want to do, who are depressed, who are stressed out.</p><p>And in the midst of all this, I just want to blow it all up and forget about it.</p><p>I just want to make you feel like you're having fun and spend time with you.</p><p>That was my first thought</p><p></p><p>I'll be happy if you had fun</p><p></p><p>I've done all I could do, but it wasn't enough, and I can't wait to perform with everyone again!</p><p></p><p>right?</p><p></p><p>I feel like I've really spent a lot of time with everyone over the last 5 years.</p><p>I felt it in my heart.</p><p>Thank you so much for getting us this far.</p><p></p><p>We will continue to deliver many good things to you.</p><p>We're going to have a lot of fun in the 6th year.</p><p>It would be great if you could watch it!</p><p>I'm still dancing and singing!</p><p></p><p>Again, it was a really good day.</p><p>I think going on, we will look back on it being a good day</p><p></p><p><img src="https://obs.line-scdn.net/0hVJbR7AwlCWVfKyGCRNl2Mil2DwomSBNtNVMeXyp9A0sqRx5lN1EDWi5tCRYvTgx2MxITUzl-Sw8FHU5vAC8uAnsvPygOXAZIKB8hZ31tVVZ7czs1FDQEH3ovXlF3H001YkVGCy8oX1B1HAsyMB4UAS8jUw/small">
