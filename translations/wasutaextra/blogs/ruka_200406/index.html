<p>It's Mishina Ruka

<p>I moved to a deserted island
</p>
<p>I'm alive and well
</p>
<br><p>I've been enduring it so far, but I felt like the time had come, so I started a new life
</p>
<p>well, it's going well so far
</p>
<br><p>Heroically weeding to sustain oneself
<br>Saving up money and building a house
<br>I contributed to the store and museum
<br>However it's only the 2nd day, so I'd like to make it better
</p>
<br><p>I don't know how far I can go
<br>All I know is it's autumn where I live
</p>
<p>I only pretended to listen to the raccoon named Tanuki-chi
<br>I didn't understand him at all, and made some odd choices and arrived at a funny place
<br>hahaha
</p>
<br><p>It's sad that I can't see the cherry blossoms in the real world, but it looks like I won't be able to see them here either
<br>hahahaha
</p>
<p>But Easter seems to be coming, and crickets and eggs coexisting now
</p>
<br><p>I used to play it on the DS, but it's so different and fun
</p>
<br><p>I'm going to play it at a leisurely pace
</p>
<p>That's my report
</p>
