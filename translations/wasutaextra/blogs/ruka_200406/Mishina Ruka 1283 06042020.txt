Good evening

It's Mishina Ruka

I moved to a deserted island

I'm alive and well


I've been enduring it so far, but I felt like the time had come, so I started a new life

well, it's going well so far


Heroically weeding to sustain oneself
Saving up money and building a house
I contributed to the store and museum
However it's only the 2nd day, so I'd like to make it better


I don't know how far I can go
All I know is it's autumn where I live

I only pretended to listen to the raccoon named Tanuki-chi
I didn't understand him at all, and made some odd choices and arrived at a funny place
hahaha


It's sad that I can't see the cherry blossoms in the real world, but it looks like I also won't be able to see them here either
hahahaha

But Easter seems to be coming, and crickets and eggs coexisting now


I used to play it on the DS, but it's so different and fun


I'm going to play it at a leisurely pace

That's my report
