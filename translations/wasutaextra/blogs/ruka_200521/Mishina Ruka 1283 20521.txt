I'm writing a blog

I'm supposed to dream a little bit every day but I always forget them in about 2 seconds
It makes me sad


Oh well, who cares


A person who keeps a lizard is cute

It's like being healed by animal videos



It's been a long time since I last wrote anything

Here's the blog

What's a blog?



It's been a while since I've had the chance to write anything
So I'm sure my writing skills have declined significantly
I'll try to write something


I'm going to really put my brain to work


It's been a while since I last used my brain
So I tried studying a bit
I can't even speak English


not that I can't speak it, but I've forgotten a lot of the English I previously learned for the first time in my life

I have the irresistible urge to rifle through textbooks from school
But I don't have them anymore, oh well


There were many things I didn't need to know for the future
but it didn't hurt to learn them
I wish I had used that knowledge somehow
I regret wasting it
So I just hope that children can have a decent life


well...


I've been living an irregular life at home
but it's only for a little while longer

I have to endure it for now
so it's hard to know how I should be living

I'm saving my energy so that I can go home whenever I want


I waaaaaant to perform

That's what I'm thinking about 99.9% of the time
the rest of the time I think about delicious rice


I can't wait to perform again

I'm going to sleep now
