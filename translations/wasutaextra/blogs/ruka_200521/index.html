<p>Good Evening
</p>
<p>It's Mishina Ruka
</p>
<br><p>I'm writing a blog
</p>
<img class="lazyload" data-src="https://obs.line-scdn.net/0hQMPxq7rzDmJtASbAL6xxNRhcCA0UYhRqB3kZWBhXBEwYbRliBXsEXRxHDhEdZAtxATgUVAtUTBILaTFUEm4gUC8CDiIzNRRUVBM4YgEFFApJWjV_KQI2GEgFWVpIOEE2V2ZBDB0AVFZFdEhmUGdHAxxR/small

<p>I'm supposed to dream a little bit every day but I always forget them in about 2 seconds
<br>It makes me sad
</p>
<br><p>Oh well, who cares
</p>
<br><p>A person who keeps a lizard is cute
</p>
<p>It's like being healed by animal videos
</p>
<br><br><p>It's been a long time since I last wrote anything
</p>
<p>Here's the blog
</p>
<p>What's a blog?
</p>
<br><br><p>It's been a while since I've had the chance to write anything
<br>So I'm sure my writing skills have declined significantly
<br>I'll try to write something
</p>
<br><p>I'm going to really put my brain to work
</p>
<br><p>It's been a while since I last used my brain
<br>So I tried studying a bit
<br>I can't even speak English
</p>
<br><p>not that I can't speak it, but I've forgotten a lot of the English I previously learned for the first time in my life
</p>
<p>I have the irresistible urge to rifle through textbooks from school
<br>But I don't have them anymore, oh well
</p>
<br><p>There were many things I didn't need to know for the future
<br>but it didn't hurt to learn them
<br>I wish I had used that knowledge somehow
<br>I regret wasting it
<br>So I just hope that children can have a decent life
</p>
<br><p>well...
</p>
<br><p>I've been living an irregular life at home
<br>but it's only for a little while longer
</p>
<p>I have to endure it for now
<br>so it's hard to know how I should be living
</p>
<p>I'm saving my energy so that I can go home whenever I want
</p>
<br><p>I waaaaaant to perform
</p>
<p>That's what I'm thinking about 99.9% of the time
<br>the rest of the time I think about delicious rice
</p>
<br><p>I can't wait to perform again
</p>
<p>I'm going to sleep now
</p>
