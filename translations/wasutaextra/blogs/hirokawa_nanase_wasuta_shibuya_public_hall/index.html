      <p>Due to the new coronavirus<br>we had to livestream this event without an audience which was fustrating<b>however, a lot of people were able to watch the livestream!</b></p>
      <p>People from all over the world wached the livestream.<br>Thank you so much!‚ú®üåà</p>
      <p>Thank you to everyone who bought a ticket<br>and was meant to be at the Shibuya Public Hall with us.</p>
      <p>Oh my gosh<br>I had so much fun!!!!!</p>

      <p>When we got to the venue<br>it was supposed to be empty.<br>However it was instead filled with loads of balloons!<br>I was moved by the kindness of the staff who made me forget my loneliness from the morning onwards.</p>
      <p>From the Waship<br>We received a lot of encouragement and messages saying that everyone was looking forward to the event.</p>
      <p>It made all the members of Wasuta really happy! I was so overwhelmed with gratitude that I couldn't put it into words.</p>
      <p>There were way too many points where I almost cried before the show even began.<br>But more than that, I'd like to talk about the live that made me cry.</p>
      <p>This time, the concert was our 5th anniversary, so we want this to be a memorial concert!</p>
      <p>??????</p>
      <p>For those of you who have been fans of Wasuta for a long time<br>It's something that makes you feel nostalgic.</p>
      <p>For those of you who have recently become acquainted with Wasuta<br>It's a great way for people to learn about the history of Wasuta.</p>
      <p>Anyway, I thought it would be nice if people loved everything about WASTA from the beginning to the present.<br>
         We had a lot of discussions with the members and staff to decide on the set list‚ú®.</p>
      <p>Because it is our 5th anniversary, it just made sense to do a concert.<br>I think that's a good way to describe it ‚ò∫Ô∏éüåà</p>

      <p>I even sang "Chiisana Chiisana" at the opening of the show to a piano.<br>If I was my old self, I would never have been able to do it because I didn't have any confidence in myself.</p>
      <p>When we sang "Doki Doki‚ô°today"<br>it reminded me so much of our first performance as Wasuta at NHK Hall.</p>
      <p>I think I am able to understand and express the lyrics of "Stand-alone Complex" far better than I could when it was first released.</p>

      <p>I'm a stronger version of myself than I used to be.<br>We sang it yesterday with the intention of communicating more.</p>
