      <p>Due to the new coronavirus<br>we had to livestream this event without an audience which was frustrating<br>however, a lot of people were able to watch the livestream!</p>
      <p>People from all over the world wached the livestream.<br>Thank you so much!✨🌈</p>
      <p>Thank you to everyone who bought a ticket<br>and was meant to be at the Shibuya Public Hall with us.</p>
      <p>Oh my gosh<br>I had so much fun!!!!!</p>
      <img src="https://obs.line-scdn.net/0hLntjTWNmE0FJEzum9sJsFj9OFS4wcAlJI2sEezxFGW88fwRBIWkZfjhVEzI5dhZSJSoJdy9GUSQedB9vc3FeRwhvMXRiYVFrMRUUei1FKjUsUyFEDSgmO2wXRHVhK1cQdH1cLz5DTnlnJBEWJiYOcmQVSg/small">
      <p>When we got to the venue<br>it was supposed to be empty.<br>However it was instead filled with loads of balloons!<br>I was moved by the kindness of the staff who made me forget my loneliness from the morning onwards.</p>
      <p>From the Waship<br>We received a lot of encouragement and messages saying that everyone was looking forward to the event.</p>
      <p>It made all the members of Wasuta really happy! I was so overwhelmed with gratitude that I couldn't put it into words.</p>
      <p>There were way too many points where I almost cried before the show even began.<br>But more than that, I'd like to talk about the show that made me cry.</p>
      <p>This time, the concert was our 5th anniversary, so we want this to be a memorial concert!</p>
      <p>With that in mind, we needed to give it our all</p>
      <p>For those of you who have been fans of Wasuta for a long time<br>It's a show which would make you feel nostalgic.</p>
      <p>For those of you who have recently become acquainted with Wasuta<br>It's a great way for people to learn about the history of Wasuta.</p>
      <p>Anyway, I thought it would be nice if people loved everything about Wasuta from the beginning to the present.<br>
         We had a lot of discussions with the members and staff to decide on the set list✨.</p>
      <p>Because it is our 5th anniversary, it just made sense to do a concert.<br>I think that's a good way to describe it ☺︎🌈</p>

      <p>I even sang "Chiisana Chiisana" at the opening of the show to a piano.<br>If I was my old self, I would never have been able to do it because I didn't have any confidence in myself.</p>
      <p>When we sang "Doki Doki♡today"<br>it reminded me so much of our first performance as Wasuta at NHK Hall.</p>
      <p>I think I am able to understand and express the lyrics of "Stand-alone Complex" far better than I could when it was first released.</p>

      <p>I'm a stronger version of myself than I used to be.<br>We sang it yesterday with the intention of communicating more.</p>
      <p>It's strange, The more I sing this song, I'm able to see new emotions from it.</p>
      <p>I was really moved by the performance of the three dancers.<br>I really wanted to see it without singing🕊!</p>

      <p>At that time the world around us became a starry sky, it was really beautiful</p>
      <p>I think we're much better at performing Stand-alone Complex now that Wasuta are becoming adults</p>
      <p>And then<br>A song included in our major debut album<br>Up till now we've never performed it.<br>"Ima wa Mukashi"</p>
      <p>The five of us sang it and connected firmly.</p>

      <p>The lyrics are wistful and tear-jerking, but<br>It's so warm and I want to keep it in my heart for a long time.</p>
      <p>I'm glad we were able to perform it at this important milestone<br>It felt like the time has come<br>I could feel the passing of time.<br>Thanks for listening to it😊</p>
      <p>And then there were songs from our starting point, back from our 'street-sei' days</p>
      <p>There weren't enough songs in the early days of Wasuta, so we perfomed them</p>
      <img src="https://obs.line-scdn.net/0hDfyYtaAGG0lEIDOu-uJkHjJ9HSY9QwFBLlgMczF2EWcxTAxJLFoRdjVmGzo0RR5aKBkBfyJ1WX8yFBRpMy88KxJSLAA-VB53KgYXKmZbACECRj1YASQGM2EkTH1sGF8WcUJUJzN3QHtsFhkeKxUGejEpQQ/small">
      <p>Now there are so many Wasuta songs that I can't just choose them all</p>
      <p>After that we had a medley of Wasuta songs<br>Ultra Choco's trilogy medley was tightly packed</p>
      <p>I had fun thinking about the script for Hazuki's narrative 😚✨</p>

      <p>Triceratops<br>Android beast demon<br>I don't care who the enemy is<br>We'll protect this world and maintain the peace 😶</p>
      <p>And above all else<br>A live band!<br>They really raised the energy 😭🔥<br>I know they were looking forward to this a lot</p>
      <p>It was thanks to the members of the NEKONOTE BAND that the show was delivered with such a sense of life and power!</p>

      <p>During the Band solo section, they were really cool</p>
      <p>PLATONIC GIRL too<br>It was so much fun! I want to do it all again 🔥😊</p>
      <p>And then<br>One by one, we gave a little speech<br>I was struggling to hold back the tears (;o;)</p>
      <p>I really wanted to see a full audience there<br>however, I was able to hold back such feelings of frustration<br>because after all, my heart was filled with so many emotions😹</p>
      <p>But that wasn't the only reason for the tears of course.<br>It was a pleasure to celebrate our 5th anniversary with the 5 of us!</p>
      <p>Thank you to everyone.</p>
      <p>I cried because I realized once again that I am supported by so many people.</p>
      <p>We've always been a proud group, though.<br>Listening to the four of them<br>made me prouder than ever before<br>we've become a group that I love very much.</p>
      <p>As the leader, I'm so proud of you.</p>
      <p>You've walked this far with me.<br>I can't thank you four enough!😊</p>
      <p>The Shibuya Public Hall Show was made with celebrating our 5th anniversary in mind.</p>
      <p>And Grapefruit Moon</p>
      <p>I think that's the coolest song I've ever sung.</p>
      <p>In addition to this<br>In the past I've always sung songs which were beyond my ability<br>was I able to sing well this time? (*¨͠*)</p>
      <p>In the past 5 years<br>I've really been through a lot.</p>
      <p>The only reason I've been able to do this<br>is because of the love and support from the Waship!</p>
      <p>I feel like the day went as well as it could🌈</p>
      <P>I think the charm of Wasuta can be best expressed in a live performance</P>
      <p>I want us to be a group that looks good on a big stage!</p>
      <p>It's been 5 years.<br>Thank you so much for all your love!</p>
      <p>Please stay tuned for the 6th year of Wasuta!</p>
      <p>I also wanted to make a big announcement that I was unable to make yesterday.<br>Until I'm able to say it<br>please keep quietly looking forward to it! ( ´´▽`` )✨</p>
      <p>6 years and beyond<br>Please continue to support us!</p>
      <p>The 5th Anniversary One-man Live<br>Thank you so much!</p>
      <p>I love you all.</p>
      <p>Shibuya Public Hall<br>We'll be back again!!!!!🤣🤣lol</p>
