<h1>1040‚ô© Hirokawa Nanase„Äê7 days till Shibuya Public Hall!„Äë</h1>
<h3>2020/3/21 18:00</h3>
<p>Hello!
</p>
<p>It's Nanase
</p>
<p>It's been a long time since I last wrote a blog„Äú„Äú‚∏å‚ç§‚Éù‚∏ç
</p>
<br><p>Today is about the 3/28
<br>I'm going to write about the Shibuya Public Hall
</p>
<img src="https://obs.line-scdn.net/0hSPU2ueWMDH9oSyRtuQBzKB0WChARKBZ3AjMbRR0dBlEdJxt_ADEGQBkNDAwYLglsBHIWSQ4eTjo2ci4qL1klYEktKxg1Pw5eFHUocTYcWjAaAxN1D341BU1PW0pDckgrUyhDERhLUUpAPkp6By5CG0wZ/small
">
<p>First, let's start at the beginning
<br>It's scheduled to happen on 3/28
<br>However the 5th anniversary one-man live at the Shibuya Public Hall
<br>was cancelled due to the new coronavirus
</p>
<p>It will instead be delivered as a livestream with no audience at the venue
</p>
<p>You've kept your schedule open for me
<br>The cost of the plane ticket/transport to get here
<br>Hotel charges
<br>Other things we can't see
<br>I'm sorry I've put you all through so much><
</p>
<br><p>There was a free live at Yoyogi park on October the 8th
<br>and from there the Shibuya Public Hall show was scheduled
</p>
<p>It's my first time performing in a hall and a one-man show too
<br>I was really looking forward to it
<br>We were all together again, and we had already achieved our goal of a sell out earlier than expected
</p>
<p>People may say that it's because of our hard work, but to me, it's unmistakably thanks to everyone. Thanks‚ò∫Ô∏é
</p>
<br><p>This scene at the Shibuya Public Hall
<br>I've seen it in my dreams over and over again, even today
</p>
<p>Each time, I looked forward to the view from the stage
</p>
<p>Of course, over all these months
<br>I didn't think for a second that it would be cancelled
</p>
<p>"I'll make the Shibuya Public Hall concert a success no matter what!"
<br>That was all I could think about
</p>
<p>I can't believe we're in such a situation right now, and all I can think about is why it had to happen at such an important time
</p>
<br><p>But even in rehearsals
<br>Actually, I'm having a change of heart
</p>
<p>because...
</p>
<p>"I don't know what will happen to the live show on 3/28 because of the situation"
<br>that kind of thing was said a lot of course
</p>
<br><p>Honestly, I was saying these kinds of things
<br>and thinking "no... but...."
<br>Because I couldn't accept it. In my head there was no way we couldn't do it
</p>
<p>But
</p>
<p>"Even if it becomes impossible to hold the event
<br>What we deliver to the fans remains the same"
</p>
<p>There were moments when I felt so strongly about that
</p>
<p>I think it's all thanks to the staff who I work with, the band members, and the members of Wasuta that I came to that conclusion
</p>

<p>Deciding whether we do it or not, of course, is important
<br>but what's more important is
<br>"delivering a good performance"
</p>
<p>I realised that this feeling had become very important to me when we were rehearsing
</p>
<br><p>But that doesn't mean I immediately accepted it when I heard about the cancellation, and it's still frustrating to this day
</p>
<p>But whatever form it takes
<br>What we want to deliver remains the same
</p>
<br><p>I'm really grateful that such an environment was able to be created for me in such a short period of time
<br>I'm sure the best way to do it is with a live concert, but even so, this is the only time we can celebrate the 5th anniversary of Wasuta
<br>I'm thinking how grateful I am to be able to deliver it now
</p>
<br><p>To Waship all over Japan, to Waship all over the world
<br>and to everyone who has yet to become a fan
<br>Anyway, I hope you enjoy this 5th anniversary show!
</p>
<br><p>And now we have an environment where we can see more people than the capacity of the sold-out Shibuya Public Hall
</p>
<p>It's way beyond that capacity
<br>I hope a lot of people see it!

<br><p>It'll be great fun
<br>I promise to deliver a live which will draw you in
</p>
<p>Our positive decisions
<br>Please give us a slap on the back
</p>
<br><p>Thanks for reading to the end!
</p>
<br><p>There are only 7 days until the Wasuta Shibuya Public Hall performance
</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to it now ‚ò∫Ô∏é

<p>2020.3.21 Nanase Hirokawa
</p>
<br><br><p>From here
<br>Is for those who want to read it! (lol)
</p>
<p>In "Grapefruit moon"
</p>
<p>"Always, always wishing, but I still can't reach it
<br>The closer I get, the further away I am"
</p>
<p>This song was originally written with us in mind but
<br>I think these lyrics are especially suitable for us now‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚†âÃ´‚Éù _ ‚†âÃÆ‚Éù _ ‚†âÃ≠‚Éû _ *<-those are meant to be faces*
</p>
<p>The closer you get, the further away you get
</p>
<p>I'm probably not even close to the future I'm envisioning yet
<br>That's why I think I can still work hard
</p>
<br><p>I'm sure you all know that
<br>we don't have time to stand around like this!
</p>
<br><p>After the Shibuya Public Hall
</p>
<p>We'll turn adversity into an ally
<br>I hope the 5 of us can become stronger after this
