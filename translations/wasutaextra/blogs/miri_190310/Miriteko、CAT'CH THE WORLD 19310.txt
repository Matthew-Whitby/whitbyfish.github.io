Thanks for visiting my blog
It's Matsuda„Éº


On the 6th of March
Our 3rd full album
„ÄêCAT'CH THE WORLD„Äë
was released!


clap clap clap

the feeling of "it's already being released"
everything's moving so fast


With the "Wonderful YEAR"
We've been doing a lot of different songs each month
There are also other collaborations and events to host
Everything has been a challenge, a year of chaos


So we've made a nicely formed album


one song at a time
one phrase at a time
It reminds me how precious time is„ÄÇ


All the fans who were by my side at that time,
All the staff who were by my side at that time,
and even the members expressions came to mind

I'm sure that's because it was such an incredibly fun time


That feeling

I hope that it's the same as yours

Miri has listened to this album dozens of times, but

I was so happy on the day of release,
even more so than usual,
so I left it playing whilst at home( ‚∏ù‚∏ù‚∏ù‚Ä¢ Ã´ ‚Ä¢ ‚∏ù‚∏ù‚∏ù )


Only those who have listened will understand
The sensation, a pounding, a feeling that comes with it
Once again, I find myself thinking
Music is amazing!üçøüçøüçøüçøüçø


Music is amazing
Wasuta's music is amazing

I can even say it myself
It's so cool and cute
I can feel the energy


As a normal, normal girl
If I just went about my daily life

I'm sure some of you are thinking
„ÄåI don't need to be stimulated if I'm ordinary„Äç but
