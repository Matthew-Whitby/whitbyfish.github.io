<p>This tour was dedicated to the mini album
<br>"Jumping Summer"
<br>Which was released on the 20th of June
</p>
<br><p>We had new creators for this mini album (songwriters)
<br>so we had new songs and a perspective of the world
<br>we didn't have before
</p>
<br><p>So for this tour, we went around the country
<br>We were able to let everyone see a new side of Wasuta
<br>I was so happy(^O^)！！
</p>
<br><p>Wasuta is now in the Wonderful Year
<br>We're releasing a new song every month
<br>We've been announcing it every month during the tour
<br>Even though we are on tour, our discography keeps increasing one after the other
<br>It was a very mysterious tour◎◎◎lol
</p>
<br><p>Normally on a tour
<br>you don't change the setlist much
<br>but with Wasuta, it's not the same
<br>There's always new songs! lol
</p>
<p>Once again, it's amazing
<br>I'm really grateful for it(´｡•ㅅ•｡`)！！
</p>
<br><p>(I'm just talking to myself here, but I'm a little hungry)
</p>
<br><br><p>And during the tour finale
<br>we released a new song(^O^)！！！！！！

<p>On the 31st of October, we will release a mini album
<br>With the lead song being ｢GIRLS,BE AMBITIOUS!｣
</p>
<p>【Take heart！Girls be ambitious！】
<br>We performed it for the first time🍖( '-' 🍖 )✨
</p>
<br><p>As the title suggests, it's a song about yakiniku！！！！！
</p>
<br><p>The meat! Grill it!🥓
</p>
<br><p>It's so much fun, it makes me so hungry◎◎lol
</p>
<br><p>This song was written by Mikito P！！！
</p>
<br><p>All the members love grilled meat
<br>so this song was made🍖🍗！！
</p>
<br><p>Hmm? All the members like it and it becomes a song…？
</p>
<br><p>That's right。
<br>It's a food song that follows Tapioca Milk Tea。
</p>
<br><p>It seems the things that Wasuta members like become songs
</p>
<br><p>The members like ____!
<br>right, let's turn that into a song!
</p>
<br><p>I think this is a very Wasuta way of thinking (lol)
</p>
<br><br><p>But I never thought that yakiniku would become a song
</p>
<br><br><p>It's the best food terror song🍖( '-' 🍖 )！！！ (~NOTE, food terror - teasing the listener with food~)
</p>
<br><p>Autumn is the perfect time to eat yakiniku when you're hungry
<br>so let's eat lots this autumn！！！！！！
</p>
