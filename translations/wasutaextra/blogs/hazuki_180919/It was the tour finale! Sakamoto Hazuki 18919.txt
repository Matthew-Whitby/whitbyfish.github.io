This tour was dedicated to the mini album
"Jumping Summer"
Which was released on the 20th of June


We had new creators for this mini album (songwriters)
so we had new songs and a perspective of the world
we didn't have before


So for this tour, we went around the country
We were able to let everyone see a new side of Wasuta
I was so happy(^O^)！！


Wasuta is now in the Wonderful Year
We're releasing a new song every month
We've been announcing it every month during the tour
Even though we are on tour, our discography keeps increasing one after the other
It was a very mysterious tour◎◎◎lol


Normally on a tour
you don't change the setlist much
but with Wasuta, it's not the same
There's always new songs! lol

Once again, it's amazing
I'm really grateful for it(´｡•ㅅ•｡`)！！


(I'm just talking to myself here, but I'm a little hungry)



And during the tour finale
we released a new song(^O^)！！！！！！

On the 31st of October, we will release a mini album
With the lead song being ｢GIRLS,BE AMBITIOUS!｣

【Take heart！Girls be ambitious！】
We performed it for the first time🍖( '-' 🍖 )✨


As the title suggests, it's a song about yakiniku！！！！！


The meat! Grill it!🥓


It's so much fun, it makes me so hungry◎◎lol


This song was written by Mikito P！！！


All the members love grilled meat
so this song was made🍖🍗！！


Hmm? All the members like it and it becomes a song…？


That's right。
It's a food song that follows Tapioca Milk Tea。


It seems the things that Wasuta members like become songs


The members like ____!
right, let's turn that into a song!


I think this is a very Wasuta way of thinking (lol)



But I never thought that yakiniku would become a song



It's the best food terror song🍖( '-' 🍖 )！！！ (~NOTE, food terror - teasing the listener with food~)


Autumn is the perfect time to eat yakiniku when you're hungry
so let's eat lots this autumn！！！！！！
