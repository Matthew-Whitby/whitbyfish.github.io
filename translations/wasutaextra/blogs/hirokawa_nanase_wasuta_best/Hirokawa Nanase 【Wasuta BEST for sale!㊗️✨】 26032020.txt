I'm not sure if you're aware

It ranked 6th in the Oricon Daily Ranking
It's all thanks to you
that we got a ranking that I can be so happy about

ÔºÅ‚ú®„äóÔ∏è

With most of the important events leading up to the release being cancelled, it's thanks to all of you that we were able to do this!

For our precious 5th anniversary album
Thank you for giving us this gift(ÔºõÔºøÔºõ)

On this album, there are so many things to see, hear and recommend
I don't even know where to begin anymore (I probably always say that)

Disc 1 is full of the title songs from the past
You could say that 'these songs represent Wasuta BEST!'
Like this is a very Wasuta-esque album

As for Disc 2
As you all know, it contains the top 10 most popular songs as voted for by the Waship
(Thanks for voting!üòä)

I think this was a bit of an emotional release, one where you can feel the path that Wasuta has taken over the past 5 years

The order of these songs is not done by most votes
But was put together as though it were a setlist
We discussed it with the staff so that it would be in a good order when people listen to it!

I'm sure our gratitude will be conveyed through our musicüê∂üåô

and not forgetting
the 2020 version of "Chiisana Chiisana"

This is originally a song
from our early days in Wasuta
It was a song which was originally just sung by Ruka and myself and has been that way since

But with the release of this BEST album
We wanted to sing it with all 5 of our voices
To sing it again and split the parts among us!

This was a song which I expressed my gratitude to my mother when singing it
I think we can now tell the story in a different way than we did back thenüïä‚ò∫Ô∏é

The colors of each of our personalities really comes out in this song
so I want you to listen to this song with that in mind„ÄÅ„ÄÅÔºÅ

I'd love to hear your thoughts too!‚ò∫Ô∏é


As for the non musical elements of the album
There is a song introduction page handwritten by each of the members on the lyrics card

In the deluxe edition, there's a video containing messages from members to other members
There's also a long interview video

It's a little embarrassing
but it's an album which symbolises Wasuta turning 5!


Even if it's your first time
I think this album is a perfect introduction to Wasuta so with that in mind I this album reaches a lot of peopleüê∂üåà


And finally
The new song "Grapefruit Moon" is featured
It's about who we are right now
Singing, dancing, the lyrics
I want you to pay attention to everything!

Of course there is a Blu-ray version of the music video
so in times like there
I hope you can enjoy Wasuta on your big screen at home‚ò∫Ô∏é‚ú®


Well then
Today is the last rehearsal for the Shibuya Public Hall Concert

I'll do my bestÔºÅ„ÉΩ(*„Éªœâ„Éª*)Ôæâ

On this day, 3/28
It will be a performance without an audience

So it will be livestreamed
https://live.mu-mo.net/

I believe this is something that only we can deliver. I want you to see this!

Thank you so much!


Thanks for the kind comments on my last blog tooüòä
I'll do my best„Äú„Äú„Äú„ÄúÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅüå∏üå∏
