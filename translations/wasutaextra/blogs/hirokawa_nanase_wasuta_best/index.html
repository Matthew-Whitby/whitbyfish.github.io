<p>I'm not sure if you're aware
</p>
<p>It ranked 6th in the Oricon Daily Ranking
<br>It's all thanks to you
<br>that we got a ranking that I can be so happy about
</p>
<p>！✨㊗️
</p>
<p>With most of the important events leading up to the release being cancelled, it's thanks to all of you that we were able to do this!
</p>
<p>For our precious 5th anniversary album
<br>Thank you for giving us this gift(；＿；)
</p>
<p>On this album, there are so many things to see, hear and recommend
<br>I don't even know where to begin anymore (I probably always say that)
</p>
<p>Disc 1 is full of the title songs from the past
<br>You could say that 'these songs represent Wasuta BEST!'
<br>Like this is a very Wasuta-esque album
</p>
<p>As for Disc 2
<br>As you all know, it contains the top 10 most popular songs as voted for by the Waship
<br>(Thanks for voting!😊)
</p>
<p>I think this was a bit of an emotional release, one where you can feel the path that Wasuta has taken over the past 5 years
</p>
<p>The order of these songs is not done by the most votes
<br>But was put together as though it were a setlist
<br>We discussed it with the staff so that it would be in a good order when people listen to it!
</p>
<p>I'm sure our gratitude will be conveyed through our music🐶🌙
</p>
<p>and not forgetting
<br>the 2020 version of "Chiisana Chiisana"
</p>
<p>This is originally a song
<br>from our early days in Wasuta
<br>It was a song which was originally just sung by Ruka and myself and has been that way since
</p>
<p>But with the release of this BEST album
<br>We wanted to sing it with all 5 of our voices
<br>To sing it again and split the parts among us!
</p>
<p>This was a song which I expressed my gratitude to my mother when singing it
<br>I think we can now tell the story in a different way than we did back then🕊☺︎
</p>
<p>The colors of each of our personalities really comes out in this song
<br>so I want you to listen to this song with that in mind、、！
</p>
<p>I'd love to hear your thoughts too!☺︎
</p>
<br><p>As for the non musical elements of the album
<br>There is a song introduction page handwritten by each of the members containing the lyrics of the songs
</p>
<p>In the deluxe edition, there's a video containing messages from members to other members
<br>There's also a long interview video
</p>
<p>It's a little embarrassing
<br>but it's an album which symbolises Wasuta turning 5!
</p>
<br><p>Even if it's your first time
<br>I think this album is a perfect introduction to Wasuta, so, with that in mind I hope this album reaches a lot of people🐶🌈
</p>
<br><p>And finally
<br>The new song "Grapefruit Moon" is featured
<br>It's about who we are right now
<br>Singing, dancing, the lyrics
<br>I want you to pay attention to everything!
</p>
<p>Of course there is a Blu-ray version of the music video
<br>so in times like these
<br>I hope you can enjoy Wasuta on your big screen at home☺︎✨
</p>
<br><p>Well then
<br>Today is the last rehearsal for the Shibuya Public Hall Concert
</p>
<p>I'll do my best！ヽ(*・ω・*)ﾉ
</p>
<p>On this day, 3/28
<br>It will be a performance without an audience
</p>
<p>So it will be livestreamed
<br>https://live.mu-mo.net/
</p>
<p>I believe this is something that only we can deliver. I want you to see this!
</p>
<p>Thank you so much!
</p>
<br><p>Thanks for the kind comments on my last blog too😊
<br>I'll do my best〜〜〜〜！！！！！🌸🌸
