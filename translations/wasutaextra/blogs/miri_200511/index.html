<h1>Miriteko„ÄÅI'm glad I remembered</h1>
<h3>2020/5/11 16:15</h3>
<p>Good day
</p>
<p>It's Miri
</p>
<br><p>Todays blog is a more private story
<br>about what made me happy recently
</p>
<br><p>I've been spending a lot of time at home lately
<br>so I've been decluttering a lot
</p>
<br><p>My mum gave my best friend and I a matching long wallet as a gift
<br>We loved it so much
</p>
<br><p>I've been using it for years
<br>and brought it with me to my house in Tokyo
</p>
<br><p>It's been the wallet I've used the most in my life
<br>but because of that it became worn out, so I finally threw it away yesterday
</p>
<br><p>When I checked the contents of it before throwing it away
<br>I found a folded piece of paper in the pocket at the end of the wallet
</p>
<br><p>An old fortune? (lol)
<br>That's what I initially thought it was
</p>

<p>It was a note from a friend from home
<br>who was with me when I was a student ( 'œâ')
</p>
<br><p>ÔºàThey're an emotional friend who sat next to me in the first year of elementary school
<br>They still come to our shows and we meet up
<br>We're very good friendsüí®Ôºâ
</p>
<br><p>Back when I started to be an idol
<br>I used to commute from Hiroshima to Osaka
<br>and would always leave early
</p>
<br><p>That's when I started doing what I wanted to do
<br>I wanted to do it but it was a little lonely at first
</p>
<br><p>But when I went to school
<br>They were always there for me
<br>I was so happy to see them there
</p>
<br><p>For some reason they suddenly gave me a love letter full of student sentiment (kind of)
<br>I was so happy to receive it
</p>

<p>We used to go to Karaoke, so nostalgic
</p>
<br><p>And to the mystery person
</p>
<br><p>I'm sorry I exposed you
<br>but it's too cute, please forgive me
<br>üòûlol
</p>
<br><p>A single word or action
<br>even if it's not a big deal to the person themselves
</p>
<p>I was so happy
<br>It might be an exaggeration
<br>but it's a great relief
</p>
<br><p>I've got a few tears in my eyes
<br>I can feel it from my own experience
<br>That's what happens isn't itüòûufuufu
</p>
<br><p>Miri at that time
<br>must have been very happy
<br>It's so cute she put it in her wallet
</p>
<br><p>I'm 20 years old, and I feel sorry for not being able to do it properly, and I'm sorry for being a bother to many people, but
</p>
<p>I'm very aware that I'm living my life with too much help from people around me
</p>
<br><p>I can genuinely believe in the words of the fans who say they were saved by WASTA's words and music, and I'm happy
</p>
<br><br><p>It's a miracle that there are so many loving people around me who can help me
</p>
<br><p>I hope that I will be able to present the joy I receive from casual words and actions to fans and the people around me
</p>
<p>I want to be an idol that not only brings me the joy of accomplishing things with my fans
<br>but also makes me feel a lot of small happiness when I am involved with them
</p>
<br><p>I had a vague idea that there were things I cherished and treasured
</p>
<br><p>It sounds like a beautiful thing
<br>but it's pretty real
<br>what I'm thinking from the bottom of my heart
</p>
<p>I wanted to blog about it today, so I wrote it üë∂üèª
</p>
<br><p>It was such a nice day yesterday
<br>It was the anniversary of the fossil excavation
</p>
<p>üë∂üèª
</p>
<br><p>How's life in Japan?
</p>
<p>I hope you're finding something fun to do
</p>
<br><p>Sorry for being greedy
<br>I'm going to do my best
<br>So may Wasuta and Matsuda Miri be a part of everyone's fun
</p>
<br><p>Every day I've been feeling a bit frustrated
<br>For lazily having fun
</p>
<br><p>But my body feels weaker these days
<br>I've got the perfect countermeasure though, a deserted road
<br>So I can go for walks
</p>
<br><p>I've been angry often today too
<br>I'll try to enjoy life as a clumsy Miri
</p>
<br><p>To those who are working hard in the midst of this difficult time
<br>Thank you
</p>
<p>And those who are studying at home
</p>
<p>and in the woods too (the best)
</p>
<br><p>Thank you as always
<br>Everyone's alive and great
</p>
<br><p>I'm hiding away in the world of Animal Crossing, as a home-based idol
</p>
<br><p>If you're playing around outside, go home!
</p>
<br><p>Let's work a little harder together, shall weü•≥
</p>
<br><p>Well then
<br>Thank you for reading
</p>
