Good day

It's Miri


Todays blog is a more private story
about what made me happy recently


I've been spending a lot of time at home lately
so I've been decluttering a lot


My mum gave my best friend and I a matching long wallet as a gift
We loved it so much


I've been using it for years
and brought it with me to my house in Tokyo


It's been the wallet I've used the most in my life
but because of that it became worn out, so I finally threw it away yesterday


When I checked the contents of it before throwing it away
I found a folded piece of paper in the pocket at the end of the wallet


An old fortune? (lol)
That's what I initially thought it was

It was a note from a friend from home
who was with me when I was a student ( 'œâ')


ÔºàThey're an emotional friend who sat next to me in the first year of elementary school
They still come to our shows and we meet up
We're very good friendsüí®Ôºâ


Back when I started to be an idol
I used to commute from Hiroshima to Osaka
and would always leave early


That's when I started doing what I wanted to do
I wanted to do it but it was a little lonely at first


But when I went to school
They were always there for me
I was so happy to see them there


For some reason they suddenly gave me a love letter full of student sentiment (kind of)
I was so happy to receive it

We used to go to Karaoke, so nostalgic


And to the mystery person


I'm sorry I exposed you
but it's too cute, please forgive me
üòûlol


A single word or action
even if it's not a big deal to the person themselves

I was so happy
It might be an exaggeration
but it's a great relief


I've got a few tears in my eyes
I can feel it from my own experience
That's what happens isn't itüòûufuufu


Miri at that time
must have been very happy
It's so cute she put it in her wallet


I'm 20 years old, and I feel sorry for not being able to do it properly, and I'm sorry for being a bother to many people, but

I'm very aware that I'm living my life with too much help from people around me


I can genuinely believe in the words of the fans who say they were saved by WASTA's words and music, and I'm happy



It's a miracle that there are so many loving people around me who can help me


I hope that I will be able to present the joy I receive from casual words and actions to fans and the people around me

I want to be an idol that not only brings me the joy of accomplishing things with my fans
but also makes me feel a lot of small happiness when I am involved with them


I had a vague idea that there were things I cherished and treasured


It sounds like a beautiful thing
but it's pretty real
what I'm thinking from the bottom of my heart

I wanted to blog about it today, so I wrote it üë∂üèª


It was such a nice day yesterday
It was the anniversary of the fossil excavation

üë∂üèª


How's life in Japan?

I hope you're finding something fun to do


Sorry for being greedy
I'm going to do my best
So may Wasuta and Matsuda Miri be a part of everyone's fun


Every day I've been feeling a bit frustrated
For lazily having fun


But my body feels weaker these days
I've got the perfect countermeasure though, a deserted road
So I can go for walks


I've been angry often today too
I'll try to enjoy life as a clumsy Miri


To those who are working hard in the midst of this difficult time
Thank you

And those who are studying at home

and in the woods too (the best)


Thank you as always
Everyone's alive and great


I'm hiding away in the world of Animal Crossing, as a home-based idol


If you're playing around outside, go home!


Let's work a little harder together, shall weü•≥


Well then
Thank you for reading
