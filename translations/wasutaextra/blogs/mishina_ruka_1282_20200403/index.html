<h1>Mishina Ruka 1282</h1>
<h3>2020/4/3 15:21</h3>
<p>How are you spending your days?
</p>
<p>I hope everyone is staying at home as much as possible
</p>
<br><p>I'm Mishina Ruka, someone who is good at staying indoors
</p>
<br><p>I've never been the type to go out on trips/holidays
<br>so this doesn't trouble me much
<br>When it comes to my daily life, there's not much difference
<br>Things are becoming quite uncertain though aren't they
</p>
<p>I've been doing more that I usually would at home, and for me that's great
</p>
<p>April fools day happened recently
</p>
<p>Wasuta went with the concept of "Fly" this year!
</p>
<p>The management were concerned with "that thing" for so long that in the corner of my mind, I thought they'd completely forgotten about it
<br>I decided on the concept of "fly"
</p>
<p>I'm a member of the Fly club
<br>There are 2 members of the club with the other being the leader, Kodama
</p>
<p>It's my third year so it's time for me to retire
<br>Over the last 3 years we haven't gained a single member so the club hasn't grown. So we're on the verge of being disbanded.
</p>
<p>We've devoted 3 years of our lives to flying, a place that's important to us, and we're hoping to get more members for the last fly.
</p>
<p>That was our scenario
</p>
<p>It was a wonderful mystery
<br>We had a great time with it
</p>
<p>This is the back story:
<br>I was actually planning to go skydiving, but I gave up due to various reasons.
<br>When I gave up, I decided to go bungee jumping. But, due to various reasons, I gave up on that too.
</p>
<p>That's why I joined the fly club.
</p>
<p>It's annoying
<br>I really wanted to do it
</p>
<br><p>I'll just have to fly in my own time
</p>
<br><p>That's what April fools day was like
<br>Thank you for your continued support this year ^_^
