It's Mishina Ruka

Good evening

〜

My birthday concert has been postponed
I'm really sorry for the last minute announcement, as it is only 10 days away、、

I'm so glad hearing how much you're looking forward to it
I don't know when it's going to be, but I hope you're still looking forward to it

I really appreciate the decision to postpone the event instead of cancelling it

I could use more time to practice!
We're going to bring you something even better next time, so stay tuned

We'll be able to announce whether the 5th anniversary live will go ahead around the 20th.
Of course I still really want to do it

!

please wait a little longer、、、

I'm sorry for my darker and darker remarks under the circumstances

Hmmm!

I'm fine!!

Let's meet again with good spirits!!!
