<p>It was reallllly<br>funnnnnnn！！！！！☺️☺️☺️☺️💞</p>
<p>It's already been a year since<br>we welcomed our first anniversary as a four-member group.</p>
<p>It feels so deep and emotional ^- ·̫ -^💭</p>
<p>The scenery and sensations we could see and feel a year ago<br>were 100 times different.</p>
<p>I thought at the moment I stood on the stage,<br>that we really worked hard this past year.ꪔ̤̮ 🏳</p>
<p>And the production, the structure, and the setlist of this time<br>I really, really loved them too much<br>All the lives we've had so far have been precious, but</p>
<p>I really enjoyed doing it myself, and I was determined to show it to as many people as possible! And I was fired up...</p>
<p>Everyone invited their friends<br>and helped spread the word, thank you...<br>꒰ ∪ > ·̫ < ∪ ꒱❤️‍🔥</p>

<p>When this live was announced,<br>I remember saying I wanted it to sell out! So, it would be a problem if it didn't! I thought, haha<br>I'm really happy that so many people gathered! <br>(For the second part, there was still a little more to go! ^- ·̫ -^ We still have to work hard!!)</p>
<p>And then,<br>what made me happy this time<br>was that cheering was allowed again</p>

<p>In the atmosphere filled with excitement,<br>we felt like we were back!!!!!!!!!!!!!😭😭</p>
<p>Everyone's voices, welcome back!!!!!!!!!😭😭😭</p>
<p>I can't put into words the emotions of that moment.</p>
<p>It's been 3 years since<br>we had a frustrating experience at the 5th-anniversary live in Shibuya Public Hall.</p>
<p>The world has become a difficult place,</p>
<p>with mostly online events<br>and many lives without people in front of us.</p>
<p>No matter what we talked about or how much we sang,<br>at first, we couldn't get used to everyone's voices not reaching the stage.</p>
<p>But, we realized that it had become the norm,</p>
<p>and we were able to do live performances even without everyone's voices.</p>
<p>But, we never really got used to it.</p>
<img class="lazyload" data-src="https://obs.line-scdn.net/0hL8azC-upExdcAwFRFrxsQCpeFXglYAkfNnsELSlVGTkpbwQXNHkZKC1FE2QsZhYEMDoJITpWUWwheykGBAAMMwpxM04OTRM0JmwIBn54NnU2Syw5MgwZbXkESy95MldGaGJfcixWTSF0NhFBYGEJdi1WRA/small">
<p>I remembered how happy a live performance with everyone's voices is<br>and how strong the sense of unity is.🌙</p>
<p>I was in tears from before the opening,<br>thinking I might not be able to sing. (;_;)</p>
<p>I was a little worried about what kind of live performance it would be, but there was no need to worry at all,<br>everyone responded with cheers many times more than I could have imagined.<br>Really, truly thank you.☺︎</p>
<p>I will never forget what happened yesterday and the moment I heard your voices.</p>
<p>In my nearly 10-year idol life,<br>this moment is in my top 3 of happy moments.</p>
<p>I cry every time I think back on it!</p>
<p>It was a happy time.</p>

<p>The anniversary live with the four of us becoming stronger<br>was so much fun with dance parts and everything.</p>
<p>And the videos, the lighting, and the production<br>were all sooo cool,🐶🐾💞<br>we couldn't get enough of watching them, they made us shine so much! (;;)(;;)(;_;) Love!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>It was amazing...</p>
<p>The staff around us<br>are really warm.</p>
<p>I love this team (;_;)...</p>

<p>I love live performances<br>and I think Wasuta is truly at its best in live performances.</p>
<p>More than anything, I think it's a miracle that we've come this far! ^- ·̫ -^</p>
<p>Even though we say "Please enjoy our 8th-anniversary love,"<br>we always receive love from all of our Wasuta fans.</p>
<p>But,<br>I think we really had a great live performance yesterday.</p>
<p>We always want to give back by delivering good performances,<br>that's what I thought.</p>

<p>Thank you for the flowers ꒰ ∪ > ·̫ < ∪ ꒱ 💞They're cute～</p>
<p>In the current Wasuta formation,<br>everyone except me is almost the same height<br>and tall, haha.</p>
<p>So, I think<br>I have to work twice as hard～……！！and</p>
<p>I've been trying to show my presence in a charming way,<br>and I feel like I've been able to do that little by little.🐶🐾</p>
<p>I hope that when I'm on stage, I appear big to everyone ^- ·̫ -^💭</p>
<p>Ah, I am</p>
<p>happy with my own height,<br>neither too big nor too small!<br>☁️‎ ∪ • ·̫ • ∪ Haha</p>
