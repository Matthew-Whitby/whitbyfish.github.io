It was reallllly
funnnnnnn！！！！！☺️☺️☺️☺️💞

It's already been a year since
we welcomed our first anniversary as a four-member group.

It feels so deep and emotional ^- ·̫ -^💭

The scenery and sensations we could see and feel a year ago
were 100 times different.

I thought at the moment I stood on the stage,
that we really worked hard this past year.ꪔ̤̮ 🏳

And the production, the structure, and the setlist of this time
I really, really loved them too much
All the lives we've had so far have been precious, but

I really enjoyed doing it myself, and I was determined to show it to as many people as possible! And I was fired up...

Everyone invited their friends
and helped spread the word, thank you...
꒰ ∪ > ·̫ < ∪ ꒱❤️‍🔥

When this live was announced,
I remember saying I wanted it to sell out! So, it would be a problem if it didn't! I thought, haha
I'm really happy that so many people gathered! 
(For the second part, there was still a little more to go! ^- ·̫ -^ We still have to work hard!!)

And then,
what made me happy this time
was that cheering was allowed again

In the atmosphere filled with excitement,
we felt like we were back!!!!!!!!!!!!!😭😭

Everyone's voices, welcome back!!!!!!!!!😭😭😭

I can't put into words the emotions of that moment.

It's been 3 years since
we had a frustrating experience at the 5th-anniversary live in Shibuya Public Hall.

The world has become a difficult place,

with mostly online events
and many lives without people in front of us.

No matter what we talked about or how much we sang,
at first, we couldn't get used to everyone's voices not reaching the stage.

But, we realized that it had become the norm,

and we were able to do live performances even without everyone's voices.

But, we never really got used to it.

I remembered how happy a live performance with everyone's voices is
and how strong the sense of unity is.🌙

I was in tears from before the opening,
thinking I might not be able to sing. (;_;)

I was a little worried about what kind of live performance it would be, but there was no need to worry at all,
everyone responded with cheers many times more than I could have imagined.
Really, truly thank you.☺︎

I will never forget what happened yesterday and the moment I heard your voices.

In my nearly 10-year idol life,
this moment is in my top 3 of happy moments.

I cry every time I think back on it!

It was a happy time.

The anniversary live with the four of us becoming stronger
was so much fun with dance parts and everything.

And the videos, the lighting, and the production
were all sooo cool,🐶🐾💞
we couldn't get enough of watching them, they made us shine so much! (;;)(;;)(;_;) Love!!!!!!!!!!!!

It was amazing...

The staff around us
are really warm.

I love this team (;_;)...

I love live performances
and I think Wasuta is truly at its best in live performances.

More than anything, I think it's a miracle that we've come this far! ^- ·̫ -^

Even though we say "Please enjoy our 8th-anniversary love,"
we always receive love from all of our Wasuta fans.

But,
I think we really had a great live performance yesterday.

We always want to give back by delivering good performances,
that's what I thought.

Thank you for the flowers ꒰ ∪ > ·̫ < ∪ ꒱ 💞They're cute～

In the current Wasuta formation,
everyone except me is almost the same height
and tall, haha.

So, I think
I have to work twice as hard～……！！and

I've been trying to show my presence in a charming way,
and I feel like I've been able to do that little by little.🐶🐾

I hope that when I'm on stage, I appear big to everyone ^- ·̫ -^💭

Ah, I am

happy with my own height,
neither too big nor too small!
☁️‎ ∪ • ·̫ • ∪ Haha

The Wasuta I've always loved

We want to keep evolving forever～！
