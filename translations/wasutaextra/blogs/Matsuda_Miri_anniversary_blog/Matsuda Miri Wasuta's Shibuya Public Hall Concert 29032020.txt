Wonderful World
Shani Muni Ikiru!

End-roll

Thank you so much!

This was our biggest one-man show in the history of Wasuta
The timing of this fifth anniversary show
I'm so glad I took on the challenge!

I'm still getting the lingering effects and the love from everyone
I'm so happy ( ‚∏ù‚∏ù‚∏ù‚Ä¢ Ã´ ‚Ä¢ ‚∏ù‚∏ù‚∏ù )

This time, in order to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus
We had to stop people from coming to the venue

But we did a live broadcast of the show instead!

We could have cancelled the show or postponed it to a later date

But it's hard to reschedule a venue
So we decided to do our 5th anniversary concert on this day and in this place
Just as we were supposed to do üéÇ

The staff worked hard with us to make it happen


Staff and members
It's frustrating

It was completely sold out. We were so close to seeing it
The one thing I want to see the most right now is the view that I can't see
It was painful

Thanks to you, We'll do it again
and in a bigger way
to see the sights we want to see

That's what I'm trying to do now

"Why isn't it free?"
I saw a lot of comments on SNS asking that

we tried to restrain the event
In order to set up an environment for the live broadcast
We were on the edge of our budget
so we had to put a price on it

We had lots of people supporting us
I'm glad to see that it was a success!

Something like that

I was good to have the livestream
It was the best we could do


Up till now I've sung
and danced to our songs
and seen so many views

Because I'm proud of it

A concert that can be delivered to everyone in front of their screens
I stood there believing that I could do it

They put balloons and penlights on the seats
And some staff danced with the penlights
The staff's love for us pierced my heart ü•∫

If you look at social media
you can see all the moments when we appealed to the cameras
That really increased the responses

#„Çè„Éº„Åô„ÅüÊ∏ãË∞∑ÂÖ¨‰ºöÂ†Ç „Åå
(Wasuta Shibuya Public Hall)
It was definitely present on 3/28 üéÅ

It's a 5 year old gift

Thank you so much

The way you all made me so excited
The way you made me smile
For bringing tears to my eyes
To see your expectations of me

These are all Miri Matsuda's reasons for being an idol
It is the greatest motivator

You're irreplaceable.
I think that's what it's all about

I want this coronavirus to be over as soon as possible


My heart is with you
I'll see you soon

Dad, mom, relatives, family and friends
all watched the broadcast yesterday

Yesterday, my beloved brother also watched us


broooooooother
He gave a nice compliment on my performance, which is rare
I was so happy ü•¥

The moment I saw his face when I got home
I felt like I was going to hit him

As an expression of joy, idiot
(lol)

Mum and brother
It was fun to make a toast


Whew

and since my body doesn't want to move much today
I'll sleep and play games

It's snowing, isn't it?

You guys take care of yourselves
I'll look forward to seeing you whenever we meet again

‚ùÑ

Instead of commenting about this blog
I want to see comments about what you thought of the show!

I'd love it if you could comment
I already saw a lot on Twitter
So you can copy and paste from there if you want ü•¥ü•¥üéÇü§ç

And today, on 2020/3/29
it's been 5 years since we formed Wasuta

Happy Birthday‚ù§

Good luck in our 6th year
