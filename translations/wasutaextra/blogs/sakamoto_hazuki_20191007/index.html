<p>Have you seen the STUDIO LIVE's yet?🎸✨</p>
<p>With us on the stage on the 10/8<br>will be the NEKONOTE BAND who've been doing photo shoots and filming videos with us!!</p>
<p>The videos are quite impressive too✨！</p>
<br><p>I've been thinking about what I can do for the free live, because all the members are doing various things for it, but I can't think of anything to do, so I'm going to write a blog, which all the members are doing, too!</p>
<p>I want to convey that in my writing</p>
<p>Well, I'll summarize the uploaded videos here!</p>
<p>🌟The biggest paradox</p>

<p>It's really fun to do live!!!!!<br>The lyrics are lovely too, so be sure to check it out☺️</p>
<p>🌟New Nyaku Nyakunya Suizokukan2</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sJonSM4TbGg?feature=oembed" allow="accelerometer;autoplay;encrypted-media;gyroscope;picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" width="480" height="270" frameborder="0">

<p>This is a very cute song, full of pitter-pattering sounds, with all kinds of fish appearing<br>🐟💓</p>
<p>🌟Ultra Miraclecle Final Ultimate Choco Beam</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JRPL9ZuKMZc?feature=oembed" allow="accelerometer;autoplay;encrypted-media;gyroscope;picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" width="480" height="270" frameborder="0">

<p>This song is based on the theme of an RPG game<br>It's super exciting to perform live✨！！！</p>
<p>Actually, it's a love song😯、、</p>
<p>Triceratops -> person you love<br>Choco beam -> trying to appeal to them</p>
<p>I approach the person I like a lot and try to appeal to them, but it doesn't work!!!!!</p>
<p>Then, at the end...☺️💓</p>
<p>🌟Stand Alone Complex</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P4_Pr0zSLRQ?feature=oembed" allow="accelerometer;autoplay;encrypted-media;gyroscope;picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" width="480" height="270" frameborder="0">

<p>One of Wasuta's twin vocal songs<br>three performers 💃form the basis of the song</p>
<p>The song is sung by the two vocal members<br>and the performance members don't have microphones<br>We're expressing the lyrics through dance!!!</p>
<p>It's a song about the feelings of the 5 Wasuta members✨<br>Who come from different parts of Japan</p>
<p>🌟PLATONIC GIRL</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TK-mu1WLSl0?feature=oembed" allow="accelerometer;autoplay;encrypted-media;gyroscope;picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" width="480" height="270" frameborder="0">

<p>The band song!🎸✨</p>
<p>Of course it's one of the most exciting songs to perform live, but the band really completes it!!!!!!</p>
<p>It's not the same as Stand Alone Complex<br>Though there's also only 2 singers in this song✨！<br>It's our strongest song✨✨、、</p>
<p>The STUDIO LIVE's show a close up of the performances<br>These 5 songs will be performed at the free live on Oct. 8th<br>We will perform all sorts of songs with the band members</p>

<p>There are videos of each of the band playing the songs on their own channels if they have one<br>They're up now, so be sure to check them out✨</p>
<p>I don't know much about musical instruments, but I'm really excited.<br>I want to see it at least once.😯</p>
<p>And be sure to check out other videos too! Give them a watch☺️✨</p>
<br><p>Now, it's finally tomorrow.</p>
<br><p>It's a free show so we won't know how many people are going to turn up on the day</p>
<br><p>However, with the help of Wasuta's staff<br>and with the help of everyone in the Waship<br>I'm sure there will be a huge turnout</p>
<br><p>I don't want to go overboard、、</p>
<p>But if it's Wasuta we're talking about, it would naturally be about that many<br>Maybe even twice as much</p>
<p>I'd like to, let's say, collect people?</p>
<p>If we think about gathering them, they will gather</p>
<br><p>I want to have a performance that transcends the barriers of being an idol</p>
<br><p>It's like: "Just because you're an idol doesn't mean you can't do it?" (lol)<br>We will do it!!!!!!!!</p>
<br><p>It's a weekday and it starts at 6pm, however,<br>It's a free live, so it's free</p>
<p>Because I'm calling you, we'll take on the challenge of doing a serious set list</p>
<p>If you can't come because of your schedule or distance<br>I hope you'll come to the Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka and Fukushima tour</p>
<p>If you're thinking of going, then go.<br>In that case I definitely want you to come so you don't think "ahh, I wish I'd gone"</p>
<br><p>It's free<br>But the quality of the performance will be as good as ever</p>
<p>We won't cut any corners. Really.</p>
<p>You don't have to be on time for the event, do your best, still come even if you are going to be late!!!</p>

<br><p>Because the members of the NEKONOTE BAND are here<br>There's nothing to be afraid of when it comes to the sound!!!! They're the strongest??</p>
