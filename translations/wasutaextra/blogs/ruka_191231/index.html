<p>It doesn't feel like the year is going to end
<br>but the end of the year is the end of the year after all
<br>it doesn't matter what it feels like
</p>
<br><p>I heard it's New Year's Eve
</p>
<br><p>I was thinking about what 2020 was going to be like, but 2020 is tomorrow
<br>It's scary〜
</p>
<p>scaryーーーー
</p>
<br><p>I've been doing a lot in 2019
<br>There was so much going on
<br>it feels like a distant memory
<br>but every time I look back
<br>I'm surprised that it was only this year
</p>
<br><p>I still want to have fun every day
<br>There's more to come
<br>I feel like I'm stronger than ever
</p>
<br><p>Personally, I was really happy with the photo book
<br>right
<br>I looked at it again recently and thought it was a good photobook, so if you haven't got it yet, please do
<br>(^_-)
</p>
<br><p>Also, as we recently announced
<br>On the 21st of March I'll have a solo live
<br>The second part of the event will just be like a normal birthday event
</p>
<p>I've been planning to do this for a long time because I wanted to do it but worried a lot about whether I actually was up to it or not
</p>
<p>It's something I'm grateful about、、、seriously、、
</p>
<p>I'm going to perform with everything in my heart
<br>I would be so happy if you could come！！！！！！！！！！！
</p>
<p>I've been feeling restless lately, and I'm sure I'll be like this until March〜
<br>I have to do my best
<br>The week after I was born, I'll be at the Shibuya Public Hall, it'll be so much funーーーーー
<br>My heart's all over the place〜
</p>
<br><p>I haven't even been back to my parents' house for New Years eve this year
<br>So it doesn't feel like the end of the year
<br>Not like spending the time with mum at home
</p>
<br><p>This is the first time I've spent the New Year in Tokyo
</p>
<br><p>"I'd like to do a countdown or something" she mutters in a small voice
</p>
<br><p>That's it for Mishina Ruka's blog 2019
</p>
<br><p>There are things I couldn't do this year, even things I still can't do now so I'll take them on next year, in overtime
<br>But there's nothing in particular that I wanted to do during the year and couldn't do
</p>
<p>I'm alive and well
</p>
<p>Well then, happy new year＾＾
</p>
<p>Mishina Ruka
