There were loads of comments

It's funny that everyone actually
feels like it's high school baseball

That's where you really felt it😂😂😂


It's different for everyone
High school baseball is still great🤚🤚🤚 lol

I'm so proud to live
in the prefecture where the Koshien stadium is located🐶🐶🐶🐶

I'll continue to show my hometown in the future‪( ´ ▽ ` )ﾉ
