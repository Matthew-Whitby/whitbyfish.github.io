Good evening

It's Kodama Ririka


Thanks for your comments‚ò∫Ô∏é


I've been back in Hokkaido for 3 days
Today I'm returning to Tokyo„Äú


Hanging out with friends
eating sushi and meat
eating lots of delicious food
meeting Maron healed me
I've become much happier after these 3 days


It's nice to be home after all


I love Sapporo

uwaaaaa

so cuuuuuuuute


I've always been watching Maron
He's so cute, he's starting to look like an angel
I've lost track over whether they're an angel or a dog


But the way Maron moves around
It's absolutely adorable
I wish everyone could meet Maron


But Maron gets scared in places with lots of people
I don't think he'd be scared enough to run though (lol)


He's really cute„Éº


I wonder when we'll see each other again„Éº


Maron's healed me a lot
So I can start working hard again tomorrow„Äú


I want to get a dog and a cat in the future„Äú


Well then
Good nightüê∂üê±
