<p>I'm sorry the title isn't related to anything</p>
<p>Good morning<br>It's Matsuda "game obsessed" Miri<img class="lazyload" data-src="https://obs.line-scdn.net/0h5HjXyWL6amdXIULJiBoVMCF8bAguQnBvPVl9XSJ3YEkiTX1nP1tgWCZnahQnRG90OxhwUTF0KCw9TitlCUJAeRZnTFIeZl15DABOaDFCSwQCU3s4GD55HXIlPFZ5GCg5ak4lCSciPVZ6EGgwOUYhVnolZg/small">
<p>I've been trying to be polite on social media<br>during this period of isolation</p>
<p>people have to be careful using social media during this period isolation</p>
<br><p>Social media is a useful tool</p>
<p>is that what it should be?<br>I think that's what I want it to be</p>
<p>That's how I feel about it</p>
<p>But I'm not smart enough to properly think about it<br>so those thoughts are just what came to mind</p>
<p>therefore we should all try to loosen up and relax<br>and forget about all the bad stuff!</p>
<p>If you follow me, I hope you can just have fun and fool around~</p>
<p>Every day, everyone's working hard<br>they might be stressed out in their own way<br>or they might just be doing what they have to do<br>or they're doing what they want to do</p>
<p>some people are working really hard<br>and they don't realise how hard they are working</p>
<p>(I've come to this conclusion by looking through some of your social media, sorry for intruding)</p>
<br><p>just think one simple thought<br>"Relax, relax, make time to relax"</p>
<p>even if you only think about it for one minute</p>
<br><p>you've done well just getting up today!</p>
<br><p>If you're thinking<br>"I'm not doing anything"<br>I'm sure that you're trying your best to do something<br>even if that something is just trying to improve your own mental stability</p>
<p>Let's work on it together~</p>
<p>I watched a video of a Wasuta performance recently<br>and I teared up a little bit</p>
<p>It made me want to go back and do another showüê∂</p>
<p>It's like a home away from home where you want to go back to, but you can't go back</p>
<p>That's my precious point! lol</p>
<p>Wasuta is precious because it reminds me of this</p>
<br><p>Ahh, I can't wait to be an Idol again</p>
<p>I'm sure you all want to become otaku again too</p>
<br><p>I'll say it once more<br>Thank you as always!</p>
<br><p>you've been very supportive of me on social media<br>even during this period of isolation<br>I'm happy!</p>
<br><p>I'm often curious about what people are thinking about<br>so let me know about any thoughts you'd like to share‚òÅÔ∏è</p>
<br><p>Haa, another day live on the air, are you going to watch with friends?<br>I hope we can become rich with friendship!</p>
<p>I'm excited!</p>
<p>There will be an OPENREC livestream at 7pm<br>so come watch it</p>
<p>Thank you for reading this little blogüíó</p>
<p>Matsuda MiriÔºè</div>
