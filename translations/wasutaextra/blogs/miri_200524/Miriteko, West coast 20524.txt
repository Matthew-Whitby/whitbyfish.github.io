I'm sorry the title isn't related to anything

Good morning
It's Matsuda "game obsessed" Miri

I've been trying to be polite on social media
during this period of isolation

people have to be careful using social media during this period isolation


Social media is a useful tool

is that what it should be?
I think that's what I want it to be

That's how I feel about it

But I'm not smart enough to properly think about it
so those thoughts are just what came to mind

therefore we should all try to loosen up and relax
and forget about all the bad stuff!

If you follow me, I hope you can just have fun and fool around~

Every day, everyone's working hard
they might be stressed out in their own way
or they might just be doing what they have to do
or they're doing what they want to do

some people are working really hard
and they don't realise how hard they are working

(I've come to this conclusion by looking through some of your social media, sorry for intruding)


just think one simple thought
"Relax, relax, make time to relax"

even if you only think about it for one minute


you've done well just getting up today!


If you're thinking
"I'm not doing anything"
I'm sure that you're trying your best to do something
even if that something is just trying to improve your own mental stability

Let's work on it together~

I watched a video of a Wasuta performance recently
and I teared up a little bit

It made me want to go back and do another showüê∂

It's like a home away from home where you want to go back to, but you can't go back

That's my precious point! lol

Wasuta is precious because it reminds me of this


Ahh, I can't wait to be an Idol again

I'm sure you all want to become otaku again too


I'll say it once more
Thank you as always!


you've been very supportive of me on social media
even during this period of isolation
I'm happy!


I'm often curious about what people are thinking about
so let me know about any thoughts you'd like to share‚òÅÔ∏è


Haa, another day live on the air, are you going to watch with friends?
I hope we can become rich with friendship!

I'm excited!

There will be an OPENREC livestream at 7pm
so come watch it

Thank you for reading this little blogüíó

Matsuda MiriÔºè
