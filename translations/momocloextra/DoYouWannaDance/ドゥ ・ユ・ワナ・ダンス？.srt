1
00:00:24,756 --> 00:00:26,756
wasn't that fun!

2
00:00:26,781 --> 00:00:28,249
So fun!

3
00:00:28,274 --> 00:00:30,258
What will we do!

4
00:00:30,283 --> 00:00:32,178
it was sparkling

5
00:00:32,203 --> 00:00:33,733
It was!

6
00:00:33,758 --> 00:00:34,708
Cute!
(That's great)

7
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:36,651
What do ya mean

8
00:00:36,676 --> 00:00:39,708
it's here at last, the finals are tomorrow

9
00:00:40,067 --> 00:00:41,462
do you think we can win

10
00:00:41,487 --> 00:00:43,985
I don't know, but surely it will be a good thing

11
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,501
because we practiced so hard for it

12
00:00:45,736 --> 00:00:49,766
if we win, we'll get the title!

13
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:51,236
we definitely will

14
00:00:51,368 --> 00:00:54,735
The title goes to Fujigawaka High School dance club

15
00:00:56,283 --> 00:00:59,921
With only 4 members they won the title!

16
00:01:01,976 --> 00:01:02,687
Hey hey hey

17
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,035
I wonder if passion will come
{INCOMPLETE}

18
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,661
It'll totally happen

19
00:01:10,138 --> 00:01:13,564
If worst comes to worst we'll try our best

20
00:01:13,589 --> 00:01:14,652
yeah

21
00:01:14,757 --> 00:01:17,022
Hey, what do you think Kanako?

22
00:01:17,179 --> 00:01:19,030
Can we win the competition?

23
00:01:23,445 --> 00:01:25,452
What's up, you're being strange

24
00:01:27,578 --> 00:01:29,865
Are you becoming even more crazy?

25
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:30,648
No

26
00:01:30,711 --> 00:01:32,546
I'm trying to digest it all

27
00:01:34,241 --> 00:01:35,528
You'll eat alright

28
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:37,045
Not like that!

29
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,817
What do you mean then?

30
00:01:39,486 --> 00:01:41,417
If I were to rank it

31
00:01:42,076 --> 00:01:46,092
This might be the most fun time of my life

32
00:01:46,889 --> 00:01:49,483
As time stands still
{REPHRASE LINE}

33
00:01:49,889 --> 00:01:51,936
I'll eat through it!!!

34
00:01:52,568 --> 00:01:54,037
well..

35
00:01:55,334 --> 00:01:56,623
what was that?

36
00:01:56,648 --> 00:01:58,494
That's not like you

37
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,540
you made me laugh

38
00:01:59,565 --> 00:02:01,474
You're overexaggerating it

39
00:02:01,499 --> 00:02:03,048
No I'm not!

40
00:02:03,381 --> 00:02:04,475
because...

41
00:02:04,604 --> 00:02:07,213
Tommorrow we'll be dancing in front of everyone!

42
00:02:07,987 --> 00:02:11,354
Along with my best friends

43
00:02:11,507 --> 00:02:14,185
The best day is happening tommorrow!
{REPHRASE LINE}

44
00:02:14,765 --> 00:02:17,835
I don't know whether we'll come 1st, 2nd or last

45
00:02:18,212 --> 00:02:22,542
Because I don't know, anything could happen

46
00:02:22,888 --> 00:02:25,121
And it all happens tommorrow

47
00:02:25,434 --> 00:02:26,192
Hey!

48
00:02:26,217 --> 00:02:28,981
is there anything more fun than this?

49
00:02:34,213 --> 00:02:35,649
I don't think there is

50
00:02:35,674 --> 00:02:36,916
Nothing?!

51
00:02:36,941 --> 00:02:39,799
This is definitely the funnest part of my life

52
00:02:39,824 --> 00:02:40,885
Thinking about it

53
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,283
What Kanako said was great

54
00:02:43,277 --> 00:02:43,996
Right!

55
00:02:45,277 --> 00:02:46,754
Do you wanna dance?

56
00:02:46,779 --> 00:02:48,863
And hold my hand

57
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:50,246
Tell me~

58
00:02:50,512 --> 00:02:51,668
Baby

59
00:02:51,981 --> 00:02:52,504
I'm

60
00:02:53,113 --> 00:02:53,988

00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:56,332
Man

63
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:58,577
no no no no

64
00:02:58,602 --> 00:02:59,755
What was that?!

65
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,045
Kanako's trying her best

66
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,721


67
00:03:02,746 --> 00:03:03,754
She tried

68
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:05,530
Right!

69
00:03:05,555 --> 00:03:06,827
Let's practice

70
00:03:08,991 --> 00:03:11,843
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?

71
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:15,216
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?

72
00:03:15,241 --> 00:03:17,225
Do you, do you, do you, do you

73
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,886
Do you wanna dance

74
00:03:20,911 --> 00:03:24,524
Oh! Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?

75
00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:27,516
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?

76
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,678
Do you, do you, do you, do you

77
00:03:29,703 --> 00:03:33,250
Do you wanna dance

78
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,988
Oh! Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance

79
00:03:37,013 --> 00:03:39,990
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance

80
00:03:40,015 --> 00:03:42,033
Do you, do you, do you, do you

81
00:03:42,058 --> 00:03:46,575
Do you wanna dance

Senda Kanako

88
00:04:35,696 --> 00:04:38,304
The police reported that as a result of dangerous driving

89
00:04:39,754 --> 00:04:43,410
The 4 of them were always

90
00:04:53,213 --> 00:04:58,525
Subbed by Whitbyfish & Retronofu

91
00:05:30,793 --> 00:05:33,371
Ogyaaa
(baby cry)

92
00:05:33,434 --> 00:05:35,550
Pushed out We Are Born

93
00:05:35,575 --> 00:05:36,949
Adjust to the sourroundings

94
00:05:36,974 --> 00:05:39,668
Jumping out and breathing is a must

95
00:05:39,693 --> 00:05:42,378
Start playing an instrument and shout

96
00:05:42,403 --> 00:05:44,793
Happy Birthday, the birthday of your life

97
00:05:44,894 --> 00:05:47,652
Hey boy, this world is heartless

98
00:05:47,691 --> 00:05:50,238
Hey girl, it's a battle of isolation

99
00:05:50,263 --> 00:05:55,293
It's a survival game without any restarts

100
00:05:55,318 --> 00:05:58,589
Beep Beep! Cry all you want

101
00:05:58,614 --> 00:06:01,316
There's no use reaching out desperately

102
00:06:01,341 --> 00:06:06,332
Living easily is against the rules

103
00:06:06,357 --> 00:06:09,496
where's my relief shelter?

104
00:06:09,521 --> 00:06:11,824
I want to keep living a cosy life

105
00:06:11,849 --> 00:06:14,988
I realize I can't go back and panic

106
00:06:15,013 --> 00:06:17,261
We're just frail beings

107
00:06:17,286 --> 00:06:22,464
Ahead the path becomes a wasteland of creatures and ambition

108
00:06:22,489 --> 00:06:24,941
Hug me, Mother!

109
00:06:24,966 --> 00:06:29,066
We are born now, we always have

110
00:06:29,091 --> 00:06:31,738
tears in our eyes

111
00:06:31,763 --> 00:06:36,074
We search this new world for a reason to live

112
00:06:36,099 --> 00:06:42,738
Born now, we have nothing to lose

113
00:06:42,763 --> 00:06:44,699
There's nothing to fear

114
00:06:44,724 --> 00:06:48,512
Even so, powerlessly and ironically, We are born!

115
00:06:50,027 --> 00:06:52,558
A fanfare emerges, fever and dance

116
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:55,613
It's not a disco, it's discommunication

117
00:06:55,638 --> 00:06:58,246
I want to tell you but I don't know language

118
00:06:58,271 --> 00:07:01,019
Speak, babel comes later, Catch up

119
00:07:01,044 --> 00:07:03,683
The origin of humanity

120
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:06,441
I'm a baby, I'm a baby, I'm just a baby

121
00:07:06,466 --> 00:07:09,152
No matter how great they were

122
00:07:09,177 --> 00:07:11,965
Yes, yes, yes, yes I was

123
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,675
Life will continue on

124
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,253
Fear & fearless it's endless

125
00:07:17,278 --> 00:07:20,451
From the moment they awaken

126
00:07:20,476 --> 00:07:22,357
Like a bee to a tearful face

127
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,621
No voice, where we were born

128
00:07:25,646 --> 00:07:28,293
No choice, who we'll meet

129
00:07:28,318 --> 00:07:33,550
In the end, we don't get to decide

130
00:07:33,575 --> 00:07:36,773
We still don't know who we are

131
00:07:36,798 --> 00:07:39,239
Baby, to a cutie like you

132
00:07:39,264 --> 00:07:42,192
We have to search for an identity

133
00:07:42,217 --> 00:07:44,629
Baby, Let's give you a name

134
00:07:44,654 --> 00:07:50,011
An unlucky rollercoaster of fate

135
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:52,255
It's too late to get off!

136
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,731
We are born now, we always have

137
00:07:56,756 --> 00:07:59,021
tears in our eyes

138
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:03,637
We can't stop ourselves from stepping into the new world

139
00:08:03,662 --> 00:08:09,965
Born now, over and over we're hurt and betrayed

140
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,927
But don't lose hope

141
00:08:11,952 --> 00:08:15,700
Like love, it's ironic, We are born!

142
00:08:16,582 --> 00:08:23,534
In the darkness, in the distance we found

143
00:08:23,567 --> 00:08:25,247
(A shining light)
In the darkness, in the distance we found

144
00:08:25,272 --> 00:08:27,349
(A shining light)
Yearning for it

145
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:30,200
Yearning for it

146
00:08:30,225 --> 00:08:37,911
We've begun to crawl out of our comfortable world

147
00:08:38,506 --> 00:08:40,731
Along a dark, narrow path

148
00:08:40,756 --> 00:08:41,964
Onwards, onwards

149
00:08:41,989 --> 00:08:43,622
All alone

150
00:08:43,647 --> 00:08:47,755
Onto the next world

151
00:08:49,292 --> 00:08:53,551
We are born now, we always have

152
00:08:53,576 --> 00:08:56,309
tears in our eyes

153
00:08:56,334 --> 00:09:00,864
We search this new world for a reason to live

154
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:07,152
Born now, we have nothing to lose

155
00:09:07,177 --> 00:09:09,090
There's nothing to fear

156
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:13,903
Born now, Born now

157
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:17,403
in order to be born again

158
00:09:17,428 --> 00:09:20,043
forget your fears, raise your head, let's go

159
00:09:20,068 --> 00:09:24,083
Even so, powerlessly and ironically, We are born!

160
00:09:50,555 --> 00:09:51,782
Reni?

161
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:55,266
Shiori?

162
00:09:57,438 --> 00:09:59,212
Ayaka?

163
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,462
Where did everyone go?

164
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:05,884
Thinking about it

165
00:10:06,422 --> 00:10:07,759
Where am I?!

166
00:10:08,423 --> 00:10:09,509
Senda~

169
00:10:17,071 --> 00:10:17,930
Yes...

170
00:10:18,836 --> 00:10:21,538
Stats: born July 12th, 2000

171
00:10:21,563 --> 00:10:24,116

172
00:10:24,141 --> 00:10:25,789
Last year's grades were:

173
00:10:25,821 --> 00:10:26,985

174
00:10:27,087 --> 00:10:28,118

177
00:10:30,525 --> 00:10:32,024
Why are you saying that?

178
00:10:32,056 --> 00:10:34,164
Are you a teacher giving guidence?

179
00:10:34,235 --> 00:10:36,594
I'm the butler, Sakagami

180
00:10:36,619 --> 00:10:39,046
and this is the angel in charge

181
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:40,915
Mi~Nya

182
00:10:41,352 --> 00:10:42,985
Mi~Nya

183
00:10:43,774 --> 00:10:45,808
She may look like a normal old person

184
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,285
she smells too much like an old woman

185
00:10:47,699 --> 00:10:48,605
an old woman?

186
00:10:51,887 --> 00:10:55,152
In the past she was terribly cute

187
00:11:04,543 --> 00:11:08,496
Sorry but ill-tempered
{INCOMPLETE}

188
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:14,996
Anyone's ok, but do you have a map

189
00:11:15,021 --> 00:11:16,879
I lost my way

190
00:11:17,684 --> 00:11:18,598
but firstly

191
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:20,410
What is this place?

192
00:11:21,028 --> 00:11:23,075
You don't know?

193
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,489
This cloudy place...

194
00:11:30,965 --> 00:11:32,262
Beppu? (Hot spring city)

195
00:11:32,287 --> 00:11:33,238
Are you an idiot?

196
00:11:33,263 --> 00:11:34,387
It's heaven

197
00:11:36,301 --> 00:11:37,575
HEAVEN?!

198
00:11:37,793 --> 00:11:40,137
Did I die or something?

199
00:11:40,692 --> 00:11:42,325
You didn't notice?

200
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,301
You were in a big accident

201
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:49,894
I don't know!

202
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:51,707
I was immersed in dancing

203
00:11:52,465 --> 00:11:56,879
♪So you're an idiot♪

204
00:11:58,191 --> 00:12:02,011
Anyway, let me meet Reni, Shiori and Ayaka

205
00:12:06,067 --> 00:12:07,432
You don't get it

206
00:12:07,457 --> 00:12:09,035
You won't meet again

207
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,496
Why?

208
00:12:13,988 --> 00:12:15,057
already,

209
00:12:15,082 --> 00:12:16,707
You've been reborn

210
00:12:16,957 --> 00:12:17,754
HUH?!

211
00:12:22,871 --> 00:12:24,879
What are you saying, I don't understand

212
00:12:24,904 --> 00:12:26,535
Fine, I'll tell you

213
00:12:38,855 --> 00:12:42,809
I'll tell you, the secret of this world

214
00:12:42,834 --> 00:12:46,644
Over there there are inifite parallel worlds

215
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:56,183
You're other life

216
00:12:56,208 --> 00:13:00,035
has been reborn it really has

217
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:03,847
but the past you is not the future you

218
00:13:03,872 --> 00:13:07,690
On the other side of the wall is a parallel world

219
00:13:07,715 --> 00:13:13,121
The next you has been born

220
00:13:13,146 --> 00:13:15,629
So the others are there too?

221
00:13:15,654 --> 00:13:16,402
Yes

222
00:13:16,427 --> 00:13:18,339
They're in a class in another city?

223
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:19,230
Yes

224
00:13:19,255 --> 00:13:21,347
Do they have different names?

225
00:13:21,372 --> 00:13:22,260
Yes

226
00:13:22,285 --> 00:13:23,894
Then let me meet them

227
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:25,129
NO!

228
00:13:25,154 --> 00:13:26,075
Why?

229
00:13:26,832 --> 00:13:30,731
I'll tell you the secret of this world

230
00:13:34,512 --> 00:13:40,222
The you from the past

231
00:13:40,255 --> 00:13:44,348
no one knows anymore

232
00:13:44,549 --> 00:13:45,549
You're lying

233
00:13:45,643 --> 00:13:50,378
There's no way Reni, Shiroi and Ayaka would ever forget about me

234
00:13:51,245 --> 00:13:54,322
I know that for sure, let me see them

235
00:13:54,347 --> 00:13:55,339
No!

236
00:13:55,557 --> 00:13:59,408
I'll tell you the secret of this world

237
00:13:59,433 --> 00:14:03,065
I'll decide where you're reborn

238
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:08,273
I'll decide with this gachapon

239
00:14:08,717 --> 00:14:12,810
the place you will go to, the gachapon knows

240
00:14:12,835 --> 00:14:14,733
What are you saying?

241
00:14:14,758 --> 00:14:18,531
I'll tell you the secret of this world

242
00:14:18,556 --> 00:14:22,423
This can cross all the barriers

243
00:14:26,771 --> 00:14:31,094
It can take you to any kind of world

244
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:43,325
The other side of the wall between worlds

245
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:49,248
As long as you have this, you can go there

246
00:14:52,686 --> 00:14:54,156
What are you doing!

247
00:14:55,007 --> 00:14:56,538
Don't come any closer

248
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,687
or I'll break it

249
00:14:59,712 --> 00:15:04,005
Stop this! Don't break something brand new, It'll be expensive to replace it

250
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:06,703
I will dance

251
00:15:07,226 --> 00:15:09,413
Along with Reni, Shiori and Ayaka

252
00:15:10,085 --> 00:15:12,476
I'll make everyone smile with my dance

253
00:15:13,273 --> 00:15:16,296
To me there's no other world

254
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:23,874
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance

255
00:15:26,749 --> 00:15:31,265
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance

256
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:37,796
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance

257
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:42,296
Do you, do you, do you, do you

258
00:15:42,321 --> 00:15:46,648
Do you wanna dance

259
00:15:46,673 --> 00:15:50,405
Oh! Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance

260
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:53,600
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance

261
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,569
Do you, do you, do you, do you

262
00:15:55,594 --> 00:15:59,421
Do you wanna dance

263
00:15:59,446 --> 00:16:03,148
Oh! Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance

264
00:16:03,173 --> 00:16:06,350
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance

265
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:08,382
Do you, do you, do you, do you

266
00:16:08,407 --> 00:16:12,663
Do you wanna dance

267
00:16:12,688 --> 00:16:14,765
I'm going now!

268
00:16:15,367 --> 00:16:17,897
Hey you guys, go stop her

269
00:16:17,922 --> 00:16:18,536
Ok

270
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:19,929
Just leave her be

271
00:16:20,195 --> 00:16:21,718
Let her do as she likes

272
00:16:21,743 --> 00:16:22,991
Minya-sama

273
00:16:30,451 --> 00:16:33,685
Let's have a little more fun with this

274
00:17:03,618 --> 00:17:04,992
You going? You staying?

275
00:17:05,017 --> 00:17:06,243
You should go

276
00:17:06,268 --> 00:17:09,492
Tell me whether you want to say it or not

277
00:17:09,517 --> 00:17:12,305
Front or back, it's an endless question

278
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:15,624
But why, what's the point of it all?

279
00:17:15,649 --> 00:17:16,891
Ah ha

280
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,516
Dig it, dig it!

281
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:19,720
Ah ha

282
00:17:19,745 --> 00:17:21,438
Dig it, dig it!

283
00:17:21,463 --> 00:17:22,548
Ah ha

284
00:17:22,573 --> 00:17:24,110
Dig it, dig it!

285
00:17:24,135 --> 00:17:25,157
Ah ha

286
00:17:25,182 --> 00:17:26,578
Dig it now!

287
00:17:26,603 --> 00:17:29,359
Can't see, can't speak, can't hear

288
00:17:29,384 --> 00:17:32,508
A wise man draws closer to death

289
00:17:32,533 --> 00:17:35,226
Just ask and I'll gladly stop

290
00:17:35,251 --> 00:17:38,162
if that's allowed then we're allowed to laugh

291
00:17:38,187 --> 00:17:43,789
The heart's voice is echoing around

292
00:17:43,814 --> 00:17:49,625
Like a carnival of tears and hope

293
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:55,031
In this feisty, dark morning

294
00:17:55,056 --> 00:17:57,204
Don't go

295
00:17:57,852 --> 00:17:59,798
Don't go

296
00:18:00,618 --> 00:18:02,930
Don't cry

297
00:18:03,524 --> 00:18:05,563
Don't cry

298
00:18:06,806 --> 00:18:09,703
Say goodbye as you fling yesterday away

299
00:18:09,728 --> 00:18:12,550
And strain your voice of courage

300
00:18:12,575 --> 00:18:17,667
for the sake of learning to love yourself

301
00:18:18,165 --> 00:18:23,989
Like a sleepless flock of sheep, the cry of the lost heart

302
00:18:24,014 --> 00:18:34,653
Don't look back, our world has just begun

303
00:18:40,598 --> 00:18:43,606
Don't be thinking lonely thoughts

304
00:18:43,631 --> 00:18:46,426
Will you do it? won't you? It's alright to not

305
00:18:46,451 --> 00:18:49,333
Crying out at unexpected disaster
{REPHRASE}

306
00:18:49,358 --> 00:18:52,723
I'll praise you with everything I have

307
00:18:53,598 --> 00:18:59,333
And then I saw a dream that continues through worlds
{REPHRASE}

308
00:18:59,358 --> 00:19:03,973
and the angels descended

309
00:19:05,138 --> 00:19:11,114
And then, at the center of an everlasting sky

310
00:19:11,139 --> 00:19:15,384
I want to be free

311
00:19:37,568 --> 00:19:43,458
1, 2 and 3, 4, 5. Get up, Stand up, free your soul

312
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:49,176
1, 2 and 3, 4, 5. Get up, Stand up, free your soul

313
00:19:49,201 --> 00:19:55,371
1, 2 and 3, 4, 5. Stand up and make some noise!

314
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:58,496
Oh-ho do it, do it

315
00:19:58,521 --> 00:20:01,362
Oh-ho do it, do it

316
00:20:01,387 --> 00:20:04,175
Oh-ho do it, do it

317
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,105
Oh-ho do it now

318
00:20:09,285 --> 00:20:15,128
The heart's voice is echoing around

319
00:20:15,153 --> 00:20:20,526
Like a carnival of tears and hope

320
00:20:20,551 --> 00:20:26,300
In this feisty, dark morning

321
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:28,534
Swinging around

322
00:20:29,128 --> 00:20:31,714
Swinging around

323
00:20:31,933 --> 00:20:34,261
Keep on advancing

324
00:20:34,778 --> 00:20:37,192
Keep on advancing

325
00:20:38,011 --> 00:20:43,855
Say goodbye as you fling yesterday away, and strain your voice of courage

326
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:49,284
for the sake of learning to love yourself

327
00:20:49,588 --> 00:20:55,323
Like a sleepless flock of sheep, the cry of the lost heart

328
00:20:55,348 --> 00:21:05,737
Don't look back, our world has just begun

329
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:15,487
Ah-ha dig it, dig it

330
00:21:15,512 --> 00:21:18,504
Ah-ha dig it, dig it up

331
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:27,003
Oh-ho do it, do it

332
00:21:27,028 --> 00:21:34,168
Oh-ho do it now, do it now, do it now

333
00:22:00,961 --> 00:22:11,773
In the bright blue sky, the hibiscus flower suddenly blooms in the summer morning

334
00:22:13,664 --> 00:22:25,226
The time we'll meet again will come, when I told my dad that, he smiled sadly a little

335
00:22:26,547 --> 00:22:38,984
You treasure and hug me, when I call out 'mum', when tears flowed from my eyes

336
00:22:39,008 --> 00:22:50,566
You're surely going to be happy from now on, always hugging me

337
00:22:51,813 --> 00:23:03,647
it's been embarassing up 'till now, to say the words out loud, but I'll always love you

338
00:23:36,809 --> 00:23:42,856
Thank you for my life, thank you from the bottom of my heart

339
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:48,971
I want to properly convey these feelings

340
00:23:49,284 --> 00:23:55,948
no matter how far apart we are, I'll always be thinking of you

341
00:23:55,973 --> 00:24:03,870
and I'll always, always, always

342
00:24:04,065 --> 00:24:08,433
Love you

343
00:24:09,034 --> 00:24:11,799
It looks wonderful on you, Endo Shiori-sama

344
00:24:11,824 --> 00:24:13,068
Really?

345
00:24:13,093 --> 00:24:14,927
It doesn't feel too fitting
{REPHRASE}

346
00:24:14,952 --> 00:24:18,979
That's not true, it fits you perfectally

347
00:24:19,004 --> 00:24:22,717
Speaking of it, I'm really nervous and restless

348
00:24:22,742 --> 00:24:25,832
Next month
Reigetsu ni a kore wo kite shikyu ageru ka ttomoto

349
00:24:25,857 --> 00:24:29,186
I feel like the person I see in the mirror is not the real me

350
00:24:29,211 --> 00:24:32,764
Ah, that is surely the 'marriage blues'

351
00:24:32,789 --> 00:24:34,732
Marriage blues? Me?

352
00:24:34,757 --> 00:24:36,989
Hanayomesan wa youku naru mitai desu yo

353
00:24:37,014 --> 00:24:39,498
Even though happiness is right in front of you

354
00:24:39,732 --> 00:24:44,201
You think 'Is this really alright?', lose hope and become blue

355
00:24:44,226 --> 00:24:46,771
You've been alone for the last 3 days haven't you
{CHECK}

356
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:50,263
business trip

357
00:25:05,162 --> 00:25:08,529
You're still saying good things about your parents
{CHECK}

358
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,548
Isn't it amazing

359
00:25:12,501 --> 00:25:15,202
With this you'll absolutely be happy

360
00:25:15,227 --> 00:25:17,093
"Is it ok to be this happy?"

361
00:25:17,118 --> 00:25:18,922
Then get anxious about it

362
00:25:20,446 --> 00:25:23,509
That's right, that sounds about right

363
00:25:23,696 --> 00:25:26,329
Sorry for saying something so selfish

364
00:25:26,555 --> 00:25:29,335
Could I be left alone for a moment

365
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,298
Of course

366
00:25:30,323 --> 00:25:32,883
Please think about your happiness

367
00:25:41,774 --> 00:25:43,493
Since I was a kid

368
00:25:43,767 --> 00:25:46,704
I've always been the obedient Shiori

369
00:25:48,095 --> 00:25:50,548
I also loved my mum and dad

370
00:25:51,376 --> 00:25:54,493
So, I always did as I was told

371
00:25:56,524 --> 00:25:58,243
During school was the same

372
00:26:00,056 --> 00:26:03,096
sitting was the same
{INCOMPLETE}

373
00:26:04,736 --> 00:26:07,322
It was the same about the person I was to marry

374
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:13,376
Watching a documentry on TV, made me think

375
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:20,895
To me,
{Finish}

376
00:26:28,517 --> 00:26:33,330
I suddenly thought I could live freely

377
00:26:35,461 --> 00:26:37,907
My heart's all over the place

378
00:26:38,977 --> 00:26:41,618
I thought about running away too

379
00:26:43,587 --> 00:26:47,423
But, I'm the good girl, Shiori-chan

380
00:26:48,493 --> 00:26:55,235
During the wedding next month, I'll probably cry beautiful tears, I know that

381
00:26:59,219 --> 00:27:00,868
I've arrived

382
00:27:01,743 --> 00:27:05,789
This is amazing! You can even go to a parallel world

383
00:27:09,688 --> 00:27:12,532
Hey, who are you, suddenly appearing here?

384
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:15,384
Shiori

385
00:27:17,145 --> 00:27:19,726
What are you wearing?

386
00:27:19,751 --> 00:27:21,547
It doesn't suit you at all

387
00:27:21,954 --> 00:27:24,210
Please don't say such rude things

388
00:27:24,235 --> 00:27:26,359
Who are you, suddenly appearing here?

389
00:27:26,384 --> 00:27:31,087
Kanako! Kanako from the dance club. Your best friend, Kanako.

390
00:27:31,352 --> 00:27:32,739
You know me right?

391
00:27:32,779 --> 00:27:35,388
How am I meant to know, We've just met

392
00:27:35,413 --> 00:27:37,325
Is your godfather
{COMPLETE}

393
00:27:38,352 --> 00:27:40,368
Who is this girl

394
00:27:41,567 --> 00:27:45,044
It's true isn't it, you've lost your memories
{CHECK}

395
00:27:45,069 --> 00:27:47,661
Where did you come from, I'll call the staff

396
00:27:47,686 --> 00:27:49,443
Wait right there

397
00:27:52,817 --> 00:27:55,028
Were you born in the edo period? (1603-1868)

398
00:27:56,247 --> 00:27:58,193
I get what's going on
{CHECK}

399
00:27:58,661 --> 00:28:01,115
The real you isn't like this

400
00:28:01,286 --> 00:28:08,966
In your heart you're a far far more silly person, much more chatty and a glutton

401
00:28:10,157 --> 00:28:12,054
I don't really know what you're saying

402
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:15,579
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance

403
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:21,664
Don't you remember, it's the song we were going to dance to in the competition

404
00:28:26,829 --> 00:28:31,009
But, somehow, I felt something in my chest

405
00:28:31,946 --> 00:28:35,532
See, inside your heart you still remember

406
00:28:35,557 --> 00:28:37,704
I'm sure your body will move too

407
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,306
No way

408
00:28:41,321 --> 00:28:45,602
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance

409
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:53,243
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance

410
00:28:53,268 --> 00:28:54,743
What? Shiori-sama

411
00:28:54,876 --> 00:28:56,976
Very

412
00:28:57,001 --> 00:29:01,212
Nothings wrong, I was just so happy I started singing

413
00:29:01,735 --> 00:29:05,149
Is that so? If you need anything else, just call

414
00:29:05,174 --> 00:29:06,298
ok

415
00:29:08,063 --> 00:29:11,064
Hurry up and go, I'm really busy

416
00:29:11,089 --> 00:29:13,476


417
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:17,892
Tomorrow's the competition! We need to dance

418
00:29:20,235 --> 00:29:23,422
You're so slow at understanding

419
00:29:23,447 --> 00:29:27,064


420
00:29:30,594 --> 00:29:31,782
See you

421
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:33,367
Wait, who are you?

422
00:29:33,392 --> 00:29:35,624
I'll see you again, I've got other places to go

423
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:36,673
Wait

424
00:29:40,922 --> 00:29:42,274
Shiori-sama?

425
00:29:42,657 --> 00:29:44,251
Endo Shiori-sama?

426
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,009
Yes?

427
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:51,383
Sorry for intruding, this is the madame of the dress salon

428
00:29:51,571 --> 00:29:54,360
You're different from the last person aren't you?

429
00:29:54,385 --> 00:29:58,118
Correct, the usual madame has gotten a little sick

430
00:29:58,143 --> 00:30:01,954
This is the temporary, singing madame

431
00:30:02,063 --> 00:30:13,009
thank you

432
00:30:16,978 --> 00:30:19,017
You're welcome

433
00:30:19,298 --> 00:30:21,071
What are you here for?

434
00:30:21,096 --> 00:30:24,196
Have you seen anything suspicious?

435
00:30:24,221 --> 00:30:26,212
Yeah, someone just appeared out of nowhere

436
00:30:26,237 --> 00:30:27,156
As we thought

437
00:30:27,181 --> 00:30:31,196
I don't really understand it but she asked me to dance with her

438
00:30:31,221 --> 00:30:36,063
As expected, so, what did you do? Did you dance together?

439
00:30:36,088 --> 00:30:38,844
I didn't do anything, my parents dislike it.

440
00:30:38,869 --> 00:30:41,593
They say dance is such a pointless thing

441
00:30:41,618 --> 00:30:43,970
So, I dislike it too

442
00:30:43,995 --> 00:30:46,383
Incredible, you've been excellently reborn!

443
00:30:46,408 --> 00:30:46,915
Huh?

444
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,492
Even so, it's too soon to tell

445
00:30:48,517 --> 00:30:51,469
She's still got the key to pass through worlds
{CHECK}

446
00:30:51,494 --> 00:30:53,743
Let's continue the plan

447
00:30:53,814 --> 00:30:56,017
Um, what was that about?

448
00:30:56,306 --> 00:30:58,665
Nothing, it's no big deal

449
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,681
Don't worry about any of that

450
00:31:01,706 --> 00:31:03,892
You're just a bit bored

451
00:31:08,501 --> 00:31:12,860
You look lovely in your dress, you'll definitely have a wonderful wedding

452
00:31:12,923 --> 00:31:16,118
To your happiness, shall we go?

453
00:31:16,143 --> 00:31:16,594
yes

454
00:31:21,314 --> 00:31:22,829
What was that about?

455
00:31:25,142 --> 00:31:26,985
Who was that girl?

456
00:31:29,353 --> 00:31:32,618
Why did I, dance?

457
00:31:34,189 --> 00:31:36,290
I won't let it bother me

458
00:39:11,695 --> 00:39:14,547
Do you, do you, do you wanna dance

459
00:39:14,572 --> 00:39:16,805
A musical would be good too

460
00:39:22,586 --> 00:39:25,374
Do you, do you, do you wanna dance

461
00:39:25,399 --> 00:39:26,671
What!
Do you, do you, do you wanna dance

462
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:27,898
What!

463
00:39:28,977 --> 00:39:32,844
Do you, do you, do you wanna dance

464
00:39:33,625 --> 00:39:37,085
Look, you're putting it together, our dance

465
00:39:41,031 --> 00:39:42,992
We'll definitely meet again

466
00:39:43,046 --> 00:39:44,367
Hey, wait

467
00:39:44,392 --> 00:39:45,875
Watanabe

468
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,898
What's up, did someone come?

469
00:39:48,727 --> 00:39:49,797
The dance

470
00:39:49,822 --> 00:39:51,867
I started to do the dance

471
00:39:52,305 --> 00:39:54,273
No way

472
00:40:06,414 --> 00:40:13,773
If a strong wind starts to blow

473
00:40:13,798 --> 00:40:19,617
and the light starts to fade

474
00:40:53,217 --> 00:41:04,068
Let's eat warming food together

475
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:29,327
Let's talk about it together and laugh

476
00:41:29,352 --> 00:41:41,193
I wonder if there's a god out there or not

477
00:41:41,218 --> 00:41:54,366
I don't really know, but with these hands {COMPLETE}

478
00:41:54,393 --> 00:42:06,868
Slowly {COMPLETE}

479
00:42:06,897 --> 00:42:13,498
There was hope {COMPLETE}

480
00:42:13,523 --> 00:42:20,076
Onwards to the other side

481
00:43:29,838 --> 00:43:30,869
Takada Reni-san

482
00:43:30,894 --> 00:43:31,487
Yes

483
00:43:32,557 --> 00:43:34,182
Sorry manager

484
00:43:57,299 --> 00:44:00,424
Sorry, I'll be more careful

485
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:23,541
Thank you

486
00:44:23,566 --> 00:44:24,338
Manager

487
00:44:25,018 --> 00:44:26,236
What is it Kabayama?

488
00:44:26,261 --> 00:44:30,987
About next weeks shift, on Tuesday and Thursday I usually go to the gym

489
00:44:38,682 --> 00:44:40,682
It's fine, I'll do them

490
00:44:46,291 --> 00:44:48,494
Thanks so much

491
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,752
I'll leave it to you

492
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:13,018
I'll do it

493
00:45:16,494 --> 00:45:19,401
It's fine, I get along with the staff well
{CHECK, OTHER POSSIBLE MEANINGS}

494
00:45:35,994 --> 00:45:38,807
Takada, good luck with all your work

495
00:45:39,307 --> 00:45:40,174
yes

496
00:45:42,494 --> 00:45:45,845
Manager, is there something different about you today?

497
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:48,064
I just changed my makeup

498
00:45:48,089 --> 00:45:50,424
It's cute

499
00:45:56,934 --> 00:45:59,309
At the same time, they'd call be ugly and bully me

500
00:46:00,028 --> 00:46:04,161
Since I was young, I thought so too

501
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:10,473
Because I had no friends and my parents were always busy I was alone

502
00:46:21,606 --> 00:46:23,560
But love always wins

503
00:47:02,973 --> 00:47:03,966
Huh?

504
00:47:22,676 --> 00:47:24,223
Don't come so close

505
00:47:24,248 --> 00:47:27,302
I'm Kanako, don't you remember?

506
00:47:27,723 --> 00:47:29,021
I don't know you

507
00:47:29,046 --> 00:47:30,661
I thought so

508
00:47:30,981 --> 00:47:33,153
Shiori and Ayaka were the same too

509
00:48:04,386 --> 00:48:09,136
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance

510
00:48:10,851 --> 00:48:15,562
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance

511
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:16,694
What's this?

512
00:48:17,429 --> 00:48:21,335
It kind of, feels warm
{REPHRASE}

513
00:48:22,225 --> 00:48:23,491
Doesn't it

514
00:48:24,194 --> 00:48:25,452
Let's dance

515
00:48:26,272 --> 00:48:27,452
No way

516
00:48:27,477 --> 00:48:31,585
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance

517
00:48:31,905 --> 00:48:32,944
What?

518
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:37,765
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance

519
00:48:38,147 --> 00:48:38,866
No way

520
00:48:38,891 --> 00:48:41,452
It's happening, this is real

521
00:48:42,163 --> 00:48:45,952
If we gather everyone, something amazing will happen

522
00:48:49,429 --> 00:48:51,351
Why did I dance like that?

523
00:48:51,376 --> 00:48:52,476
Takada-san

524
00:49:30,487 --> 00:49:33,604
I don't know my friends

525
00:49:43,385 --> 00:49:50,893
I want to go meet my real self

526
00:49:55,206 --> 00:49:59,136
No matter where

527
00:50:07,893 --> 00:50:11,940
Don't cry

528
00:50:14,182 --> 00:50:17,839
Don't lose

529
00:50:50,307 --> 00:50:55,120
I'll believe in myself

530
00:51:17,377 --> 00:51:21,784
Is this a dream?

531
00:51:23,471 --> 00:51:27,909
Why is it so?

532
00:51:29,901 --> 00:51:34,362
Can you see it?

533
00:51:36,151 --> 00:51:40,745
Is it love?

534
00:52:58,245 --> 00:52:59,690
Excuse me

535
00:52:59,715 --> 00:53:00,573
Yes?

536
00:53:00,598 --> 00:53:02,126
Where is this?

537
00:53:02,151 --> 00:53:04,971
I don't know either, I got lost

538
00:53:04,996 --> 00:53:05,940
You too?

539
00:53:05,965 --> 00:53:09,448
Yeah, this strange person appeared

540
00:53:09,776 --> 00:53:11,112
Was she called Kanako?

541
00:53:11,137 --> 00:53:12,096
That's right

542
00:53:12,121 --> 00:53:13,479
Me too

543
00:53:13,504 --> 00:53:18,287
She had sparkling eyes but said unbelievable things right?

544
00:53:18,312 --> 00:53:22,604
That's right, she was like a positive idiot

545
00:53:41,166 --> 00:53:43,783
She said I didn't suit my wedding dress

546
00:53:43,808 --> 00:53:46,393
You're getting married?

547
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:02,378
I'm Shiori

548
00:54:05,964 --> 00:54:08,658
I'm Reni, I'm a nurse

549
00:54:09,229 --> 00:54:12,526
I'm Ayaka, the acting club's director

550
00:54:12,744 --> 00:54:17,003
And the 3 of us have all previously met Kanako

551
00:54:17,324 --> 00:54:20,971
Didn't she say something weird, something about the past

552
00:54:20,996 --> 00:54:26,050
Yeah she did, that we were all part of the same dance club in the past

553
00:54:27,784 --> 00:54:31,010
Could it have been us?

554
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:34,994
"Tomorrow's the competition, we have to dance"

555
00:54:39,955 --> 00:54:42,276
No way, something so silly

556
00:54:59,698 --> 00:55:01,206
I don't know

557
00:55:01,843 --> 00:55:05,037
But I thought, is this alright?

558
00:55:17,198 --> 00:55:20,393
But she sung it right?

559
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:23,237
That dance song

560
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,619
She did

561
00:55:27,425 --> 00:55:30,136
My heart seemed to remember it

562
00:55:32,002 --> 00:55:35,307
Then my body started to move itself

563
00:55:38,846 --> 00:55:43,886
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance

564
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:51,042
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance

565
00:55:53,162 --> 00:55:55,951
Do you, do you, do you, do you

566
00:55:55,976 --> 00:56:03,834
Do you wanna dance

567
00:56:05,279 --> 00:56:08,522
That's good, everyone's gathered

568
00:56:09,665 --> 00:56:13,195
Hey, you. Why have we all been brought here?

569
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:14,504
Where is this?

570
00:56:14,529 --> 00:56:18,803
I didn't do anything, you guys chose to come here right?

571
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:23,764
I don't know where this is either

572
00:56:32,254 --> 00:56:36,668
Anyway, I wanted to talk to you all now you're here

573
00:56:40,877 --> 00:56:42,254
This goes shoot

574
00:56:42,576 --> 00:56:43,836
and, shoot

575
00:56:45,397 --> 00:56:46,813
This goes shoot

576
00:56:47,429 --> 00:56:49,050
I don't get it

577
00:56:49,436 --> 00:56:51,115
Are you really an idiot?

578
00:56:52,186 --> 00:56:53,490
But that's funny

579
00:56:53,689 --> 00:56:56,785
It does sound like this girl came up with a story
{CHECK}

580
00:56:57,022 --> 00:56:59,397
It's fine if you don't believe it

581
00:56:59,578 --> 00:57:01,717
It might be unbelievably weird

582
00:57:02,253 --> 00:57:05,407
but would you just listen to my story?

583
00:57:07,404 --> 00:57:08,772
What is it?

584
00:57:10,318 --> 00:57:13,654
We are all from the same school's dance club

585
00:57:14,186 --> 00:57:15,576
All second year

586
00:57:16,561 --> 00:57:21,006
We became friends in first year, then formed the dance club

587
00:57:26,605 --> 00:57:29,682
we watched loads of dance videos on youtube

588
00:57:29,707 --> 00:57:33,588
We always practiced during breaks, after school, even at the weekend

589
00:57:48,779 --> 00:57:51,990
To perform on that stage together

590
00:57:52,015 --> 00:57:53,998
It's the greatest feeling

591
00:57:54,049 --> 00:57:58,760
We thought that it was the most fun time in our lives

592
00:58:00,542 --> 00:58:02,338
and then

593
00:58:05,159 --> 00:58:07,026
and then?

594
00:58:09,253 --> 00:58:11,596
we were killed in a traffic accident

595
00:58:11,870 --> 00:58:13,073
eh?

596
00:58:14,308 --> 00:58:18,698
Reni, Shiori, Ayaka and I died

597
00:58:19,481 --> 00:58:22,361
Then before I realised it
{CHECK}

598
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:25,425
you guys were reborn

599
00:58:26,105 --> 00:58:27,245
huh?

600
00:58:28,337 --> 00:58:31,716
When being reborn, the possibilites are infinite
{CHECK}

601
00:58:32,237 --> 00:58:35,534
Why's that? Because parallel worlds are infinite

602
00:58:36,581 --> 00:58:40,096
but then, I tried searching for you

603
00:58:44,183 --> 00:58:46,893
 The luck of the gachapon

604
00:58:46,918 --> 00:58:50,750
Even so, I really think this is fate

605
00:58:51,716 --> 00:58:54,946
It's so odd, it's hard to believe it

606
00:58:54,971 --> 00:58:56,495
but it's interesting

607
00:58:56,776 --> 00:58:59,081
if it's all true, that's really crazy

608
00:58:59,106 --> 00:59:00,862
You can't believe that

609
00:59:00,887 --> 00:59:02,206
I don't believe it

610
00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:06,911
I don't belive this, I'm just a good girl who listens to her parents

611
00:59:06,936 --> 00:59:08,464
Just a normal, good girl

612
00:59:08,489 --> 00:59:10,438
That's not true Shiori

613
00:59:11,964 --> 00:59:15,135
You were the most obsessed with dancing

614
00:59:15,886 --> 00:59:19,034
That song, you found it on youtube

615
00:59:19,424 --> 00:59:24,206
Because I'm bad at English, everyone put it into katakana

616
00:59:27,565 --> 00:59:33,300
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance

617
00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:35,143
Do you remember?

618
00:59:35,627 --> 00:59:40,151
It's like, when I see everyones faces, I remember a little

619
00:59:44,917 --> 00:59:49,909
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance

620
00:59:51,042 --> 00:59:53,143
See, you knew that right?

621
00:59:53,315 --> 00:59:56,706
I don't really know it, it came from within my chest

622
01:00:00,683 --> 01:00:03,893
Do you, do you, do you, do you

623
01:00:03,918 --> 01:00:10,464
do you wanna dance

624
01:00:11,057 --> 01:00:12,690
You're doing it!

625
01:00:13,721 --> 01:00:17,097
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance

626
01:00:17,122 --> 01:00:20,495
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance

627
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:22,537
Do you, do you, do you, do you

628
01:00:22,562 --> 01:00:26,730
Do you wanna dance

629
01:00:26,755 --> 01:00:30,417
Oh! Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance

630
01:00:30,442 --> 01:00:33,550
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance

631
01:00:33,575 --> 01:00:35,714
Do you, do you, do you, do you

632
01:00:35,739 --> 01:00:39,440
Do you wanna dance

633
01:00:39,690 --> 01:00:43,181
Oh! Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance

634
01:00:43,206 --> 01:00:46,409
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance

635
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:48,370
Do you, do you, do you, do you

636
01:00:48,395 --> 01:00:53,511
Do you wanna dance

637
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,159
One, two

638
01:01:06,141 --> 01:01:08,201
Come on out to the front

639
01:01:09,721 --> 01:01:12,276
The real thing starts now

640
01:01:13,487 --> 01:01:16,722
5, 6. 5, 6, 7 go

641
01:01:23,456 --> 01:01:27,956
Hey! You lot back there, what are you doing? Come join the others

642
01:01:28,299 --> 01:01:30,145
Don't stand apart

643
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:34,339
5, 6. 5, 6, 7 go

644
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:42,924
Ok, change the line

645
01:01:43,875 --> 01:01:45,095
(Time?) is quick
{CHECK CHECK CHECK}

646
01:01:45,223 --> 01:01:46,766
Jump to the beat

647
01:01:46,791 --> 01:01:48,337
Feel it in your toes

648
01:01:48,667 --> 01:01:51,823
5, 6. 5, 6, 7 go

649
01:02:00,212 --> 01:02:02,454
That concludes the first round

650
01:02:02,479 --> 01:02:04,285
Please wait there for the results

651
01:02:04,310 --> 01:02:05,251
Understood

652
01:02:05,276 --> 01:02:07,331
Huh.. Ok!

653
01:02:08,709 --> 01:02:10,916
Hey, what's going on here?

654
01:02:10,941 --> 01:02:12,746
Looks like I messed up

655
01:02:12,771 --> 01:02:15,379
we were supposed to go to the competition

656
01:02:15,404 --> 01:02:16,726
Is this an audition?

657
01:02:16,751 --> 01:02:17,830
What's this audition for?

658
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:18,865
I don't know

659
01:02:18,890 --> 01:02:20,525
Hey, you four

660
01:02:20,632 --> 01:02:21,873
yes?

661
01:02:21,898 --> 01:02:23,748
I can't see your entry numbers

662
01:02:24,149 --> 01:02:25,633
What entry numbers?

663
01:02:25,658 --> 01:02:26,395
Ah!

664
01:02:32,390 --> 01:02:34,021
What's this about?

665
01:02:34,056 --> 01:02:36,395
Right then, I'll announce the results

666
01:02:36,893 --> 01:02:38,879
put them on

667
01:02:38,904 --> 01:02:40,047
Quickly

668
01:02:41,941 --> 01:02:51,795
1, 4, 5, 8, 11, 13, 14, 17

669
01:02:52,507 --> 01:02:53,924
That's all

670
01:02:55,378 --> 01:02:56,961
Thanks for trying

671
01:02:57,957 --> 01:02:59,842
Thank you very much

672
01:03:02,547 --> 01:03:04,520
I'm the manager, yamagami

673
01:03:04,890 --> 01:03:06,589
Before the final round,

674
01:03:06,614 --> 01:03:09,783
The producer, chako will say a few words

675
01:03:14,910 --> 01:03:16,375
I'm Chako

676
01:03:16,971 --> 01:03:22,811
Our vision is to create a unique idol group never seen before

677
01:03:22,888 --> 01:03:24,504
They'll start from their first show

678
01:03:24,529 --> 01:03:27,322
and grow together with the fans

679
01:03:27,576 --> 01:03:31,375
I want to see your confidence

680
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:34,592
I don't need it to be beautiful

681
01:03:34,617 --> 01:03:37,850
Sing with everything, dance with everything

682
01:03:37,875 --> 01:03:39,324
But

683
01:03:39,695 --> 01:03:42,410
The guarantee for success is...
{POSSIBLE REPHRASE}

684
01:03:45,135 --> 01:03:46,385
none

685
01:03:49,793 --> 01:03:52,752
If you're not prepared, please leave

686
01:03:55,438 --> 01:03:57,332
The last round will be an interview

687
01:03:57,508 --> 01:03:59,842
Please show me what you've got

688
01:04:06,922 --> 01:04:09,861
Then the interviews began

689
01:04:10,261 --> 01:04:13,494
I hadn't thought of being an idol before

690
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:17,575
I don't know why I'm here, but I am

691
01:04:18,777 --> 01:04:21,570
I'm sure the people who failed will feel fustrated

692
01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:26,824
I don't want to lose, that feeling began to emerge

693
01:04:27,390 --> 01:04:29,158
Let's dance

694
01:04:30,008 --> 01:04:32,498
You want to dance right? The four of us

695
01:04:34,109 --> 01:04:35,144
I wanna dance

696
01:04:36,463 --> 01:04:37,645
I wanna dance

697
01:04:39,324 --> 01:04:40,740
  I wanna dance

698
01:04:41,375 --> 01:04:43,787
Alright, let's have the next group

699
01:04:48,845 --> 01:04:52,947
I'll ask a question, please answer individually

700
01:04:54,402 --> 01:04:57,938
What are dreams to you?

701
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:04,236
To live more freely

702
01:05:05,173 --> 01:05:07,830
To receive appeal and an applause

703
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,691
To have self confidence

704
01:05:12,664 --> 01:05:14,919
For the four of us to dance

705
01:05:15,389 --> 01:05:18,387
Also, to make everyone smile

706
01:05:19,321 --> 01:05:20,876
One more question

707
01:05:21,837 --> 01:05:29,829
Please tell me what 'Dance' means to you in one word

708
01:05:31,907 --> 01:05:33,298
Freedom

709
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:36,394
A wave
{CHECK}

710
01:05:37,353 --> 01:05:38,696
Courage

711
01:05:40,884 --> 01:05:42,384
Friendship

712
01:05:43,104 --> 01:05:46,394
Thank you, that's the end of the questions

713
01:05:48,634 --> 01:05:51,392
I'll now announce the results

714
01:05:56,610 --> 01:06:12,337
numbers 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 19, 20, 21

715
01:06:12,362 --> 01:06:15,782
All of you have passed, congratulations

716
01:06:17,243 --> 01:06:19,438
We passed!?

717
01:06:19,463 --> 01:06:23,921
Listen up, your groups name will be 'Heaven'

718
01:06:23,946 --> 01:06:28,189
So from now, you will be members of Heaven

719
01:06:30,626 --> 01:06:31,860
Let's do our best!

720
01:06:35,173 --> 01:06:38,804
Do you wanna dance and hold my hand

721
01:06:38,829 --> 01:06:41,915
Tell me baby I'm your lover man

722
01:06:41,942 --> 01:06:47,731
Baby, do you wanna dance

723
01:06:47,756 --> 01:06:51,707
Do you wanna dance under the moonlight

724
01:06:51,732 --> 01:06:54,346
Hold me baby {Oh true night?????}

725
01:06:54,371 --> 01:06:59,917
Baby, do you wanna dance

726
01:06:59,942 --> 01:07:03,549
Oh, do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance

727
01:07:03,574 --> 01:07:06,893
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance

728
01:07:06,918 --> 01:07:08,643
Do you, do you, do you, do you

729
01:07:08,668 --> 01:07:12,401
Do you wanna dance

730
01:07:12,426 --> 01:07:16,182
Oh, do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance

731
01:07:16,207 --> 01:07:19,265
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance

732
01:07:19,290 --> 01:07:21,218
Do you, do you, do you, do you

733
01:07:21,243 --> 01:07:25,007
Do you wanna dance

734
01:07:51,382 --> 01:07:55,195
Oh, do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance

735
01:07:55,220 --> 01:07:58,182
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance

736
01:07:58,207 --> 01:08:00,237
Do you, do you, do you, do you

737
01:08:00,262 --> 01:08:03,800
Do you wanna dance

738
01:08:03,825 --> 01:08:07,449
Oh, do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance

739
01:08:07,474 --> 01:08:10,526
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance

740
01:08:10,551 --> 01:08:12,581
Do you, do you, do you, do you

741
01:08:12,606 --> 01:08:16,199
Do you wanna dance

742
01:08:16,226 --> 01:08:20,015
Oh, do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance

743
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:23,163
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance

744
01:08:23,188 --> 01:08:25,077
Do you, do you, do you, do you

745
01:08:25,102 --> 01:08:29,650
Do you wanna dance

746
01:08:29,675 --> 01:08:34,455
This is so fun! I want to dance with everyone forever

747
01:10:29,549 --> 01:10:31,378
Full powered girl

748
01:10:31,418 --> 01:10:34,814
I'll always love you with everything I have

749
01:10:34,825 --> 01:10:38,792
I just wanted to tell you that

750
01:23:06,717 --> 01:23:07,951
Do your best

751
01:23:07,976 --> 01:23:08,655
ok

752
01:23:09,115 --> 01:23:10,194
bye bye

753
01:23:10,670 --> 01:23:12,936
bye bye

754
01:27:37,612 --> 01:27:40,845
I can't sop smiling

755
01:27:40,870 --> 01:27:44,377
My heart won't stop dancing

756
01:27:44,402 --> 01:27:47,955
so I start to move towards you

757
01:27:47,980 --> 01:27:52,229
Run! Run! Run!

758
01:28:06,244 --> 01:28:12,134
I've always seen you on the same train as me

759
01:28:12,159 --> 01:28:20,273
I wonder when it began, when these feelings inside my heart became so big

760
01:28:20,298 --> 01:28:27,157
Unable to ever start a conversation

761
01:28:27,182 --> 01:28:31,108
I always pretended to talk with my friends

762
01:28:31,133 --> 01:28:34,562
whilst watching you from the corner of my eye

763
01:28:34,587 --> 01:28:38,100
I don't want to regret anymore now I've noticed these feelings

764
01:28:38,125 --> 01:28:41,702
I don't want to lie to myself or run away from it

765
01:28:41,727 --> 01:28:50,413
I'll gather up all my overflowing feelings and put them all into words

766
01:28:50,438 --> 01:28:53,694
I can't stop smiling

767
01:28:53,719 --> 01:28:57,233
My heart won't stop dancing

768
01:28:57,258 --> 01:29:00,827
and so I start to move towards you

769
01:29:00,852 --> 01:29:03,968
Run! Run! Run!

770
01:29:03,993 --> 01:29:07,963
Right now I don't have the courage!

771
01:29:07,988 --> 01:29:11,541
There aren't enough little chances

772
01:29:11,566 --> 01:29:15,033
and so I start to move my body

773
01:29:15,058 --> 01:29:19,025
Run! Run! Run!

774
01:29:19,050 --> 01:29:20,885
nothing starts if you wait

775
01:29:20,910 --> 01:29:22,658
I want to face you with all my strength

776
01:29:22,683 --> 01:29:24,400
We were born on this same planet

777
01:29:24,425 --> 01:29:26,353
We were born in the same period of time

778
01:29:26,378 --> 01:29:27,978
words like chance are such simple words

779
01:29:28,003 --> 01:29:29,893
disagreeing and accidentally distancing ourselves

780
01:29:29,918 --> 01:29:33,385
just thinking of it hurts my chest

781
01:29:33,410 --> 01:29:37,275
I want to get to know the real you, even now

782
01:29:37,300 --> 01:29:40,619
however many years, however many decades, from now unto forever

783
01:29:40,644 --> 01:29:44,385
because we only have one chance to live

784
01:29:44,410 --> 01:29:49,916
I want to be honest when I'm with you

785
01:29:49,941 --> 01:29:54,236
even so I still can't give you an answer

786
01:29:54,261 --> 01:29:57,728
I can't even say the smallest of words

787
01:29:57,753 --> 01:29:59,336
"I love you"

788
01:29:59,361 --> 01:30:05,947
will those words alone change the world, will they?

789
01:30:07,080 --> 01:30:10,135
I can't stop smiling

790
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:13,705
My heart won't stop dancing

791
01:30:13,730 --> 01:30:17,314
and so I start to move towards you

792
01:30:17,339 --> 01:30:20,400
and run! Run! Run!

793
01:30:20,425 --> 01:30:24,244
Right now I don't have the courage!

794
01:30:24,269 --> 01:30:27,963
There aren't enough little chances

795
01:30:27,988 --> 01:30:31,556
and so I start to move my body

796
01:30:31,581 --> 01:30:35,869
and run! Run! Run!

797
02:03:18,914 --> 02:03:21,914
Dark weekend, come on Raideen!

798
02:03:30,718 --> 02:03:33,593
Dark weekend, come on Raideen!

799
02:03:33,618 --> 02:03:36,413
No more laughing today

800
02:03:36,438 --> 02:03:39,288
My power was cut

801
02:03:39,313 --> 02:03:42,538
I'm on the verge of crying

802
02:03:42,563 --> 02:03:45,280
Dark weekend, come on Raideen!

803
02:03:45,305 --> 02:03:46,780
Where are the tickets to the promised land?

804
02:03:46,805 --> 02:03:48,226
A sleepless doll, stripped of freedom

805
02:03:48,251 --> 02:03:49,726
Cold and hungry nightmares

806
02:03:49,751 --> 02:03:51,274
their fingers point to those who don't arrive

807
02:03:51,299 --> 02:03:52,827
Wanting worship, more and more

808
02:03:52,852 --> 02:03:56,343
I'm left wanting more

809
02:03:57,126 --> 02:04:00,127
This timing is a curse

810
02:04:00,152 --> 02:04:03,197
(the power has been cut)
screaming 'till my nose bleeds, is that supposed to happen?

811
02:04:03,222 --> 02:04:06,189
Ruin is collapsing onto me

812
02:04:06,214 --> 02:04:09,423
Dark weekend, come on raideen!

813
02:04:09,448 --> 02:04:14,618
Poison comes from my mouth, burying into the mud

814
02:04:14,643 --> 02:04:20,978
Left in silence with my weakness

815
02:04:21,003 --> 02:04:26,435
Ripping open a door, shaken to the soul

816
02:04:26,460 --> 02:04:31,132
I heard a serious voice

817
02:04:31,157 --> 02:04:32,717
Hit me firmly

818
02:04:32,742 --> 02:04:38,561
Selling your soul for victory won't bring joy

819
02:04:38,590 --> 02:04:42,996
I heard the voice once again

820
02:04:43,021 --> 02:04:44,496
Raideen echos

821
02:04:44,521 --> 02:04:47,222
My soul is embedded into my heart

822
02:04:47,247 --> 02:04:51,551
The beat awakens me

823
02:04:51,848 --> 02:04:54,293
Abracadabra

824
02:05:17,012 --> 02:05:18,332
Aarin

825
02:05:22,348 --> 02:05:25,441
Standing before me, dazzling my eyes

826
02:05:25,466 --> 02:05:29,238
I see a god of salvation

827
02:05:29,263 --> 02:05:32,292
He has chosen me

828
02:05:32,317 --> 02:05:35,964
He believes in me, let's move onwards

829
02:05:35,989 --> 02:05:39,417
I won't miss out on my wish

830
02:05:39,442 --> 02:05:43,347
counting on the pride of consuming the darkness

831
02:05:49,676 --> 02:05:53,081
If I mourn, nothing new can be born

832
02:05:53,106 --> 02:05:56,699
If I become wild, it'll be in vain

833
02:05:56,724 --> 02:06:00,191
I recieved in gratitude

834
02:06:00,216 --> 02:06:03,042
I live off giving back

835
02:06:03,434 --> 02:06:06,839
I know, you know the agony of pain

836
02:06:06,864 --> 02:06:10,988
If can I love, I can pray

837
02:06:11,746 --> 02:06:14,566
Clear the way, Let's go!

838
02:06:25,191 --> 02:06:28,042
Calm the pain

839
02:06:28,067 --> 02:06:30,775
This world lives off negativity

840
02:06:30,800 --> 02:06:33,964
Always take the chance to move ahead

841
02:06:33,989 --> 02:06:36,949
Hold on, don't let go

842
02:06:36,974 --> 02:06:39,840
Hey, come on. Hello Raideen

843
02:06:39,865 --> 02:06:42,762
Hey, come on. Hello Raideen

844
02:06:42,787 --> 02:06:45,706
Hey, come on. Hello Raideen

845
02:06:45,731 --> 02:06:48,542
Hey, come on. Hello Raideen

846
02:06:48,567 --> 02:06:51,675
Firmly join together, we're invincible

847
02:06:51,700 --> 02:06:54,574
Brace yourself and get ready. It's wonderful

848
02:06:54,599 --> 02:06:57,574
I hate unfinished arguments

849
02:06:57,599 --> 02:07:00,988
Being straightforward is best

850
02:07:01,199 --> 02:07:04,136
A cruel merry go round

851
02:07:04,161 --> 02:07:06,324
causes tears to spiral

852
02:07:06,349 --> 02:07:12,941
Bury the flame of evil with a trial

853
02:07:12,966 --> 02:07:18,003
Poison comes from my mouth, burying into the mud

854
02:07:18,028 --> 02:07:26,035
Left in silence with my weakness, forever

855
02:07:27,176 --> 02:07:32,925
Ripping open a door, shaken to the soul

856
02:07:32,950 --> 02:07:37,425
I heard a serious voice

857
02:07:37,450 --> 02:07:39,003
Hit me firmly

858
02:07:39,028 --> 02:07:44,730
Selling your soul for victory won't bring joy

859
02:07:44,755 --> 02:07:49,160
I heard the voice once again

860
02:07:49,185 --> 02:07:51,027
Raideen echos

861
02:07:51,052 --> 02:07:57,956
Thanks to your blessing, I won't give up

862
02:07:57,981 --> 02:08:02,800
I'll pierce through the torn sky

863
02:08:02,825 --> 02:08:06,832
My Soul is embedded into my heart

864
02:08:06,857 --> 02:08:12,644
The sound of this beat has gained meaning

865
02:08:12,669 --> 02:08:14,519
Abracadabra

866
02:08:14,544 --> 02:08:18,652
Even through those twisting, difficult times

867
02:08:18,677 --> 02:08:21,566
Like Noah's ark

868
02:08:21,591 --> 02:08:24,542
We'll go towards the future

869
02:08:24,567 --> 02:08:26,371
without wasting any time

870
02:08:26,396 --> 02:08:33,324
I won't forget the places and people I met

871
02:08:33,349 --> 02:08:36,277
Like Noah's ark

872
02:08:36,302 --> 02:08:39,246
I embraced them

873
02:08:39,271 --> 02:08:43,012
The shining weekend

874
02:09:51,397 --> 02:09:52,459
AARGGH

875
02:09:52,631 --> 02:09:53,819
It hurts!

876
02:10:01,532 --> 02:10:03,344
that was funny wasn't it

877
02:10:03,391 --> 02:10:04,212
yeah

878
02:10:04,282 --> 02:10:06,140
the world of dreams is great

879
02:10:06,165 --> 02:10:07,415
I feel like a kid again

880
02:10:11,271 --> 02:10:12,661
is this really Ok

881
02:10:13,224 --> 02:10:14,091
what?

882
02:10:15,114 --> 02:10:17,380
Kanja-san's waiting for me

883
02:10:17,911 --> 02:10:20,528
Tanaka-san's grandma
NOT COMPLETE

884
02:10:22,795 --> 02:10:23,998
you're right

885
02:10:24,576 --> 02:10:26,787
I can't give up on my acting club either
CHECK

886
02:10:29,354 --> 02:10:31,175
what about my marriage?

887
02:10:32,432 --> 02:10:33,901
I can't run away from it

888
02:10:34,729 --> 02:10:37,338
I can't leave him to the kitchen

889
02:10:40,816 --> 02:10:42,691
If we think about it

890
02:19:41,092 --> 02:19:45,008
If we labelled that short lived dream we formed that day as 'A'

891
02:19:45,033 --> 02:19:48,466
Then the future will be 'B'

892
02:19:48,491 --> 02:19:55,360
If there's a god out there, please let 'A' and 'B' become the same

893
02:19:55,399 --> 02:19:57,176
Combine them, draw a line between them

894
02:19:57,201 --> 02:19:59,080
Then chip at them, break them

895
02:19:59,105 --> 02:20:03,133
That's the conclusion I came to every time

896
02:20:03,158 --> 02:20:08,895
Don't say that 'it's a mistake' that you managed to find me

897
02:20:09,862 --> 02:20:13,807
Even if we're reborn, and can still understand

898
02:20:13,832 --> 02:20:17,782
Make me remember once more

899
02:20:17,807 --> 02:20:21,185
Watch as we reach our limit
{CHECK}

900
02:20:21,210 --> 02:20:29,530
Just don't forget us, always

901
02:20:31,951 --> 02:20:37,382
Always

902
02:20:41,930 --> 02:20:45,770
Let the distance between you and I be 'C' and 'D'

903
02:20:45,795 --> 02:20:49,569
Like equal, parallel lines

904
02:20:49,594 --> 02:20:53,172
Even now you can still dance along to that eight beat song

905
02:20:53,197 --> 02:20:56,971
that'll bring us closer together

906
02:21:11,558 --> 02:21:13,579
Write it down, erase it

907
02:21:13,604 --> 02:21:15,347
break the pencil lead

908
02:21:15,372 --> 02:21:19,087
Still, I can't give an answer

909
02:21:19,112 --> 02:21:23,149
Tear up the answer sheet

910
02:21:23,174 --> 02:21:33,132
Even so, I'll still solve it

911
02:21:33,157 --> 02:21:39,168
The dream I saw with you

912
02:21:40,482 --> 02:21:44,291
Even if we're reborn, and can still understand

913
02:21:44,316 --> 02:21:48,305
Make me remember once more

914
02:21:48,330 --> 02:21:51,742
Watch as we reach our limit
{CHECK}

915
02:21:51,767 --> 02:21:56,088
Just don't forget us

916
02:21:56,860 --> 02:22:01,029
The entirety of the your dancing figure

917
02:22:01,054 --> 02:22:04,809
is laughing, sending the same message as always

918
02:22:04,834 --> 02:22:08,305
From the moment I remember being reborn

919
02:22:08,359 --> 02:22:11,450
to the future, let's get along

920
02:22:11,830 --> 02:22:15,667
Even if we're reborn, and can still understand

921
02:22:15,692 --> 02:22:19,672
Make me remember once more

922
02:22:19,697 --> 02:22:23,080
Watch as we reach our limit
{CHECK}

923
02:22:23,105 --> 02:22:26,450
Just don't forget us

924
02:22:26,475 --> 02:22:31,201
Always

925
02:22:33,793 --> 02:22:38,715
Always

926
02:23:11,468 --> 02:23:15,902
Hey, what was your name again?

927
02:23:15,927 --> 02:23:19,703
Where did we meet again?

928
02:23:19,728 --> 02:23:23,208
When was it again?

929
02:23:23,233 --> 02:23:27,144
What were we doing again?

930
02:23:27,169 --> 02:23:30,756
What was your face like again?

931
02:23:30,781 --> 02:23:34,350
What was your voice like again?

932
02:23:34,375 --> 02:23:38,032
What kind of person where you again?

933
02:23:38,057 --> 02:23:41,870
Where was your favourite place again?

934
02:23:41,895 --> 02:23:45,425
I don't want to forget

935
02:23:45,450 --> 02:23:49,028
I don't want to forget

936
02:23:49,053 --> 02:23:52,876
Let's meet again tomorrow

937
02:23:52,901 --> 02:23:56,694
Let's make it a promise

938
02:23:56,719 --> 02:24:00,318
Even if we're reborn

939
02:24:00,343 --> 02:24:03,999
Even if we're reborn

940
02:24:04,024 --> 02:24:07,739
I don't want to change
{CHECK CONJUGATION}

941
02:24:07,764 --> 02:24:12,280
I'll always find you again

942
02:24:31,787 --> 02:24:32,810
Bye bye

943
02:24:33,255 --> 02:24:34,716
Don't forget me
